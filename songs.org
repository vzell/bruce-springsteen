** 4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)

**** On the tracks

4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) - V1	5:47	US5 / BIS / ROOI / SA914 / ET / ETRJ
4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) - V2	5:35	PS / EY / ROOI / SA914
4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) - V3	5:31	WIESS / ESSENTIAL / CHAPTER / 1975 German single
Note: A song destined to be special to all people of New Jersey, especially those who remember the summers of the mid-70s at the Jersey shore. First known studio take on August 9, 1973, which turned out to be the second to last session for WIESS. Recorded V1, the instrumental backing track, and V2, the original take, with "Now, Sandy, them northern angels lost their desire for us, I spoke with them last night, they won't set themselves on fire for us anymore, still, when the weather gets hot, they ride that crazy road down from heaven on their Harleys every season they come and they go, dressed like stars in all them cheap little seaside bars, they're parked with their babies out on the Kokomo…love me tonight and I promise I'll love you forever….". V3 is the album version, mostly from August 9, but with overdubs and mixing on September 23, 1973, including Bruce adding a new final verse, with "nicer" lyrics. When he played back, "I promise you I'll love you—forever?", he must have instantly decided it had to be redone…but then he did it again on the overdub! No wonder she dumped him. He changed the words in the live set at The Main Point on October 31.

Written in early 1973 at Diane Lozito's Bradley Beach house, it was, according to Bruce, "a good-bye to my adopted hometown and the life I'd lived there before I recorded. Sandy was a composite of some of the girls I'd known along the Shore. I used the boardwalk and the closing down of the town as a metaphor for the end of a summer romance and the changes I was experiencing in my own life". At Bushnell Memorial Hall, Hartford, CT, on April 23, 1973, '4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)' opened the set, the earliest confirmed performance of the song. Brucebase reader Ed was present, and says: "I know Bruce opened with "4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)", but the rest of the show is just a blur. No one in the audience had ever heard Bruce before, and the crowd loved him! He ended up doing about 45 minutes of encores, and finally had to leave the stage so Richie Havens could perform. Throughout the Richie Havens show people kept calling for Bruce!"

Diane says she was Sandy, along with the Thundercrack girl and Rosalita.

Note: 'Lost Masters III' liner notes say tracks 1-5 are all from August 1977, but Sony logs say track 5, "Prove It All Night" was first cut September 12, 1977, track 3, "Factory", was not even called "Factory" until 1978, and the first take of "Daddy Raised A Cain", was on November 9, 1977, with "Adam Raised A Cain" V2 on December 15, 1977. The Darkness album take, V3, resulted from three consecutive days dubbing, mixing and editing, on February 15, 16 and 17, 1978. Before his death in 1998, Doug Springsteen was asked which of his son's songs he liked best. "The ones about me", he answered.

** Ain’t Good Enough for You

**** On the tracks

WHAT'S THE MATTER LITTLE DARLIN' - V1	3:49	DROC2 / RRR
WHAT'S THE MATTER LITTLE DARLIN' - V2	4:06	DDITV / MT1 / AM / DROC2
AIN'T GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU - V3a	4:01	PROMISE
AIN'T GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU - V3b	1:49	PROMISE: DELUXE
Note: V2 first appeared in the 1990s on 'Deep Down In the Vaults' as "What's The Matter Little Darling", the name it was known by for years. V1, is a recording on 'The Definitive River Outtakes Collection Volume 2' with the same name, faster pitch, and inferior quality, that runs 15 seconds slower. In the studio logs of the Darkness sessions, there are no records of "Ain't Good Enough For You" or "What's The Matter Little Darling". Author Clinton Heylin believes takes were recorded on August 9 and September 26, 1977 at the Record Plant, under the names, "New Rocker" and "First New Rocker". The first official appearance of this song was on the second CD of "The Promise" as "Ain't Good Enough For You", and he makes the good point that on the accompanying Thrill Hill Vault DVD (V3b), Bruce is shown trying to add a vocal overdub to an already existing track at the Record Plant, which suggests it had been recorded earlier. V3a has more developed lyrics than V2, including "getting cool like Jimmy Iovine" and "Sherry Darling" party noises. This song bears some slight resemblance to "This Little Girl", the hit song Bruce donated to Gary U.S. Bonds in 1980.

AMERICAN SKIN (41 SHOTS) - V3 		uncirculating
AMERICAN SKIN (41 SHOTS) - V4 	7:24 	HOPES

Note: Written by Springsteen during the spring of 2000 and premiered live on June 4, 2000 at a show with the E Street Band in Atlanta. It appears that this recording utilises the backing music (with a slightly altered mix) from the live version recorded on July 1, 2000 at Madison Square Garden and officially released on Live In New York City. Springsteen recorded V1 a new vocal at The Hit Factory, New York City on March 2, 2001. Produced by Springsteen and Chuck Plotkin. Released on a promotion-only single in June 2001. Studio vocals were laid over a different mix of the released live version's instrumental tracks. Producer Ron Aniello revealed in a December 2013 interview with Rolling Stone's Andy Greene that American Skin (41 Shots) V2 was cut during the Wrecking Ball-recording sessions, but ultimately was not used. "We did try a track of that", he said, "but it wasn't really an outtake". V3 was recorded in studio again in 2013 and featured Tom Morello on guitar. "His presence made a big, big difference", Springsteen said. "He obviously brings those things to great life and deepens them and deepens the characters". Prior to the March 2013 Australian leg of the Wrecking Ball Tour, Tom Morello was sent the song to play guitar on V4. "I did that in my home studio and Bruce seemed to like that very much", He told Andy Greene in a January 2014 interview for Rolling Stone. "That song to me was the most challenging one. It was also the first one I did. Normally I'll go in there and tinker with a song a bit and try to capture inspiration and see if the world likes it or not. But that song just didn't come together for me. I went back to it a couple of times, and I'm glad that I did because at the end of the day I was really pleased with how the guitar solo and the rhythm stuff came out. But that one felt like it was work. I had to really work on that one".

Note: Much is made about how it took 6 months to finish the song, "Born To Run". However, Jungleland, Thunder Road, and Backstreets all probably took longer. Bruce Springsteen was determined to create a masterpiece, and he held off the record company and his managers until it was made, and even then his team had to convince him that it was done, to get him to stop. The musical tracks to these songs seemed to come together much more quickly than the lyrics, Backstreets being a prime example. The circulating outtakes are organized mainly by the progression of the lyrics, which are described below. The bridge was finally completed with the album in July 1975, months after all the music was in place. Some of these takes feature lavish overdubs of guitars and strings, but when the composition was finally complete, the experimentation was dropped, and the album version was Bruce's powerful vocal in front of the E Street Band.

Early drafts of Backstreets from 1974 go by "Hidin’ On The River". After Roy Bittan and Max Weinberg joined the E Street Band in August 1974, "the new band went to [914 Sound Studios] Blauvelt…made stabs at "Backstreets" V1 (a late-night betrayal song)" per Clinton Heylin, who reports this occurred on October 17, 1974. Apparently, these sessions did not go well, and after several months of slow progress, Bruce asked Jon Landau to come aboard in March 1975, and one of his first moves was to move the album #3 sessions to the Record Plant. On April 25, their second week there, Bruce opened his book to his latest lyrics for "Backstreets" (which was about 2 verses), and V2a was recorded; it can be identified because the 2nd verse starts with "Running in the dark"; also, the bridge is mostly unwritten, with, "Save yourself a new guitar string to get you around by", not one of his best lines. But by the 3rd verse, and on to the end, Backstreets is taking shape, with the band working hard, led by Roy's majestic piano, Danny's organ, Max and Garry. They have just learned Backstreets, and though sloppy, they are already playing like the machine they are. V2b is a short 3:12 take, and circulates in some private CDR sources; this is the same take and mix as V2a. Version 2c, released on E Street Radio, almost got it's own version, which would have been called "the guitar version", and the end actually sounds different, but that is Bruce guitar dominating this mix.

Version 3, the "strings Backstreets", was cut May 19 or 23, and now has "St. Johns" in the 2nd verse; the bridge needs work, in fact the bridge is so bad, that instead of "the heroes in the funhouse ripping off the __", two guitar solos would have been preferable. But a great piece of rock and roll music is starting to rise. v3a and 3b are vastly different mixes; the only reason they are not separate versions is they share the same lyrics, and were probably cut on the same day. Version 4 had to be cut on May 23 or July 6; the source quality is poor (version 4b is pitch correction remastered by Fanatic Records, V4c is 30 seconds short), but what stands out is the second verse is complete. However, the bridge remains incomplete; the writer envisions a confrontation of great emotional power, but the words are still not there. The strings do not make the song, and when they go away, they are not missed. Bruce and the band have conquered the end of the song. The final album sequence of July 2, 1975, had Backstreets as the album closer, but this was revised to the current configuration on July 7. Version 5, which is the album take and final mix, was completed on July 18, 1975, with a vocal overdub of the bridge, which makes Backstreets the classic powerhouse that it is, one of Bruce's finest compositions. Nobody who listens to this song can come away without being impressed by the musicianship of Roy Bittan; Backstreets remains his finest hour. It would be hard to pull off a song that projects this kind of power, without a roomful of fantastic musicians, and a vocalist equal to the task. When critics were raving about Bruce Springsteen in the fall of 1975, Thunder Road, Jungleland and Backstreets were the best of the best; their reaction was from being blown away multiple times by the same album.

The story only started here. Soon after the band took Born To Run on the road, Bruce and especially Roy started performing Backstreets with another segment added after the third verse and chorus, refusing to let all the built up emotion go to waste. Bruce developed "Sad Eyes" and "Drive All Night" during these interludes, with his voice and the piano dictating the pace of emotions, eventually joined by Max pounding his drums to add to the build up, which would finally go back to Backstreets and finish the song. This went on for years, through many tours, becoming a regular part of the show, with nobody quite knowing what to expect each night.

Note: Unfortunately, very few outtakes circulate of "Badlands", the anthem he opened concerts with for years, although there must be some good stuff waiting in the vaults. Remember, title, music, lyrics, the Springsteen method of songwriting. The title came from Terrence Malick's 1973 movie, Badlands (he had not seen the movie). In late June, the music had been composed, and was first played by the E Street Band on June 27, 1977 at Atlantic Studios. The song's opening riff, Springsteen revealed years later, is a major-key twist on the minor-key intro to the Animals' 1965 hit 'Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood'. V1 is an instrumental backing track, recorded on June 27 and 30. Max Weinberg said his opening drum part was suggested by Steve Van Zandt, and inspired by Motown. Bruce had a routine with his engineers to create 'Ruffs' tapes for him, so he could take instrumental or early recordings home and write lyrics. V2 had to be recorded in late June, or on July 11 or 13 at Atlantic Studios. Springsteen was working at Atlantic Studios on July 13, 1977, when the twenty-five-hour-long New York City blackout began; soon after, the opening line "Lights Out Tonight", came into being. New takes, with developing lyrics, were recorded on August 24 and 30, 1977, but contrary to Lost Masters liner notes and many other sources, no outtakes circulate from these sessions.

It wasn't until November 1977, that Badlands was re-written with new lines, including, "I wanna go out tonight, I wanna find out what I got" from 'Iceman', about which he later honestly recalled, "That whole record was a record where I felt like I was going to have to test myself, and that was what I wanted to know, so that line ended up in a few different songs"—Los Angeles Times interview, 1998. Next, from a song by Elvis Presley from the 1962 movie, Kid Galahad, King Of The Whole Wide World: "A poor man wants to be a rich man, A rich man wants to be a king, But the man who can sing when he hasn't got a thing, He's the king of the whole wide world". Bruce translated this to these Verse 2 lines: "You better get it straight, darling, Poor man wanna be rich, rich man wanna be king, And a king ain't satisfied till he rules everything, I wanna go out tonight, I wanna find out what I got". Verse 3 was strengthened by, "For the ones who once had a notion, it ain't no sin to be glad you're alive" from Break Out.

V3 was recorded on December 12, 1977 at the Record Plant, with many new pieces in place. Bruce is still yelling at 'the man on the TV', but "Badlands" has started to take shape. The vocals for V4, the album version, were dubbed in during a three-day mixing marathon on February 22, 24 and 25, 1978. V4b is an alternate, with less double-tracked vocals than the Darkness version, and V4c was the final mix from April 11, which was pressed to acetate on April 12, 1978. V5 take 23 was a last moment dubbing, on May 5, 1978, of Clarence Clemons' sax solo. Springsteen's initial excuse for almost leaving it off was that he believed the instrument evoked the city, leaving it out of place on an album set in something more like "the heartland"; he later admitted, "that would have been a major error".

Be True - Recording - https://musicbrainz.org/recording/221e2125-a941-4682-a074-8570525224b9


The disambiguation change to "1981 B-side version" in edit
https://musicbrainz.org/edit/64396931 and the "Advanced Relationship" edit
"Be True (1981 B-side version) by Bruce Springsteen is a recording of Be True on 1979-07-18"
in https://musicbrainz.org/edit/64396972 are driven by the
information on [http://brucebase.wikidot.com/song:be-true|Brucebase] and
[https://www.springsteenlyrics.com/lyrics.php?song=betrue|Springstenlyrics] (see below at the end)
Both sites are the two best Springsteen researched sites on this planet...

If you click on the "On The Tracks" tab on the
[http://brucebase.wikidot.com/song:be-true|Brucebase] page you'll find that
there are up to now eight (8) different recordings of "Be True" known to have
been released on either official or bootleg mediums:

The Brucebase website states in the Note section:

So the version in question here is V1g, which can be found on:
"1981 b-sides" - for example [https://musicbrainz.org/release/50b81faa-e8c5-44bf-91b0-16d8698d2754|Fade Away] and [https://musicbrainz.org/release/ad2f3795-7140-464d-80b3-979dafd0a4ac|Cadillac Ranch]

That's why I think the advanced relationship "recording of Be True on 1979-07-18" but disambiguation "1981 b-side"
is OK. I wanted to base the disambiguation on an official release which happend to be on 1981 singles first
but the actual recording happened on 1979-07-18.


Even the Discogs link https://www.discogs.com/release/1936207 you mentioned states => B3 'Be True' (Studio 1981) - B Side from "Cadillac Ranch" single.

There is also the following info on [https://www.springsteenlyrics.com/lyrics.php?song=betrue|Springstenlyrics]

''Info'':

BE TRUE is a song written by Bruce Springsteen and first released as the
non-album B-side of FADE AWAY in 1981. The same version of the song was also
included on the Tracks box set in 1998. The above lyrics are for Bruce
Springsteen's official studio version of BE TRUE as first released in 1981.

Another studio version of BE TRUE (official studio version 2) was released on
The Ties That Bind: The River Collection box set in 2015.

''Studio Recording'':

According to the Tracks liner notes, BE TRUE was recorded on 21 Jul 1979 at The
Power Station in New York City, NY, but this date is not listed on Sony's
database of Springsteen recording sessions, which only lists 18 Jul 1979 at The
Power Station. It is possible that the date listed on the Tracks liner notes is
incorrect, or it could be that the song was cut during both the 18 Jul 1979 and
21 Jul 1979 sessions. In his 2012 book E Street Shuffle: The Glory Days of Bruce
Springsteen & the E Street Band, Clinton Heylin also listed 22 Apr 1980. That
date is most likely for a mixing or overdub session.

Two studio takes of BE TRUE have surfaced and both were officially released:
official studio version 1 and official studio version 2. They both must have
been recorded during the 18 Jul 1979 or 21 Jul 1979 session at The Power
Station.

BISHOP DANCED	4:21	TRACKS
Note: "Bishop Danced" had a short life span, from December 5, 1972 to March 2, 1973. When it was chosen for Tracks, a live recording from January 31, 1973 was used. Bruce explained before the song, "Uh, this next song is a kind of nonsense song. I'll give you a quick rundown … It's about a bishop and his wife and this violin player in West Virginia. It's about how their daughter lost her mother to mathematics out on a business trip in Detroit." Which explains why some forgotten vinyl bootlegger titled it, "Mama Knows Arythmatic Knows How To Take A Fall".

** Blinded by the Light
*** Brucewiki - http://brucebase.wikidot.com/song:blinded-by-the-light
**** On the tracks

BLINDED BY THE LIGHT - V1a 	5:03 	GREETINGS / ESSENTIAL: 2003 / GH09
BLINDED BY THE LIGHT - V1b 	3:58 	1973 Single

Note: According to Springsteen in "Songs", both "Blinded By The Light" and "Spirit In The Night" were written to order, after Clive Davis told him in mid-August 1972, there was nothing on Greetings From Asbury Park, New Jersey which could get radio play. His response was to go home with a rhyming book, which is what he used to write "Madman’s Bummers", which he changed to "Blinded By the Light", and without delay, "Spirit" and "Blinded" were both recorded on September 11, 1972. This was much to the satisfaction of his record label, who were pleased with the songs, and even more by their new artists' response to their implied request. Unnoticed was Henry Boy', which garnered respectable attention during the August Max's Kansas City residency, but was never played again. Perhaps Bruce used most of the song in creating 'Blinded By the Light', just like he did with 'Walking In the Street' when creating 'Thunder Road'. The legendary rhyming dictionary helped him with the lyrics, but 'Henry Boy' was the instant source of the music.

After the 'Greetings' sessions were completed, and the master submitted on August 10, most of the not-yet-called The E Street Band had dispersed to other obligations; David Sancious and Danny Federici were in Virginia, and Miami Steve was playing with the Dovelles. Bruce found his drummer, Vini "Mad Dog" Lopez, special guest star Clarence Clemons, who had not played in the June sessions, and Harold Wheeler to play piano; he played the rest of the instruments. It is not known how many takes were needed to finish 'Blinded', but it was completed in one day. Before it was released as a single on February 23, 1973, coupled with "The Angel", the engineers at Columbia edited out a verse, reducing the time below four minutes. It was "given an extremely limited commercial release in the U.S.". The lyrics on the back of the 7” picture sleeve are also missing a verse. A stereo fold down mono version is available as the b-side of the white label promo 45.

Note: On the road in the Mid-South late in 1973, he awoke suddenly one morning, grabbed his notebook, and inked in the title BORN TO RUN. A few weeks later, "Bruce, the band, and Appel got back to work at the 914 Sound Studios on January 8, 1974, spending a couple of days fiddling with rudimentary versions of both Born to Run V1 and Jungleland V1."-Bruce by Peter Ames Carlin. According to Bruce, the entire writing and recording process took six months while he was living at a rented cottage at 7½ West End Court in West Long Branch, which suggests it began in late 1973. V2a is the original backing track recorded at 914 Sound Studios on May 21, 1974, after obviously being rehearsed and practiced in prior days. V2b from June 26, 1974 dubs in Bruce's vocals to the V2a track. Bruce continued work on the song, adding lyrics and overdubs, at 914 Sound Studios, both in June and then starting a week's residency on August 1, 1974. Finally, on August 6, 1974. the final version was mixed down from seventy-two tracks to the sixteen available at 914 Studios, including strings, more than one dozen guitar tracks, sax, drums, glockenspiel, bass, multiple keyboards and a variety of voices. The core backing track V3 was mixed, along with numerous test arrangements V4x, with backing vocals, double-tracked vocals and strings, and finally the one chosen for release V5a. An advanced tape release of the official version V5b, first aired on WMMR in Philadelphia on November 3, 1974 (V5c), and subsequently broadcast by several USA radio stations during November 74-July 75. There is little difference between these versions.

Sifting through all the information and "fake news" on 'Born To Run' is agony; it is obvious many records of studio takes, dubbing and mixing work are missing. V6 was an unreleased tape from October 16 cancelled by Columbia. There is a studio log entry on March 17, 1975, which was not a dub or mix session. We will mark that V7. Over the years, more than ten alternative mixes of Born To Run have leaked out, and this a short list and description of those we could identify. V4a has a double tracked vocal and strings; V4b has double tracked vocals. strings, and a female chorus; V4c also has a female chorus. V4d has a female chorus that doesn't kick in until the 3rd verse; V4e is an alternative mix with only basic instrumental backing; V4f has only guitars in the instrumental backing; V4g does not have a drum track. V4h is Bruce's vocal without any backing instruments; V4i features string and enhanced high end; v4j has less overdubbing; V4k does not include the middle verse and the sax solo; this was released by Ktel-CBS in Australia-only in early 1976 on a multi-artist LP called Supersounds.

recording_19770601-atlantic-demo-tape.jpg
Note: "God's Angels", alternately named "The Fast Song", was a fast-paced melody written over several months, starting in Spring 1977. For many nights on the last legs of the Lawsuit Tour, Bruce interpolated the lyrics of "God's Angels" into "Backstreets". When he got to Atlantic Studios, New York on June 1, he had music and additional lyrics written. Though studio logs show the first take was on June 6, evidence exists that it was recorded on June 1, the first day of sessions (see 'Star Wars' tape below). Instrumental track V1 was worked on in early June. The lyrics heard in V2a can only be found in very poor quality on 'Darkness Outtakes Volume 3 (The Promise)', but features an incredible searing guitar solo, strangely never to be heard again. "I wish God's Angels would tear this town down, blow it into the sea, and that's okay with me because I don't care" stayed with the song, perhaps until the final takes and mixing of "Candy's Room" in March 1978, but it was deleted, and now only heard in bootlegs. V1, 2a-2d were worked on June 6, 9, 10, 13, 14, 20 and 24, and again on August 24, September 1 and 2, 1977, and lyrics slightly change, such as God's Angels alternate "man that's alright with me I don't care anymore". The only song he worked on harder was "Racing In the Street". All of the lines were blown into the sea, starting with changes at the end of September 1977.

The evidence is a bit confusing, but it is not hard to conclude that "Candy's Room" was around since at least May 1977, and was connected to "The Fast Song", as evidenced by the Ampex cassette jacket ('The Star Wars' tape), dated June 1, 1977. Springsteen's mind at this point was turning faster than ever with song ideas; an early concept album, Badlands was set to be released in October 1977, but he postponed it until June 1978. Nothing illustrates his process as well as "Candy's Room". After September 2, 1977, the last time "The Fast Song" and "Candy's Boy" would appear on the logs, Bruce decided to re-organize them into a new 'Fast Song', giving his obsession (Candy) the home she deserves. On September 27, "The New Fast Song" V3 appeared for the first time on studio logs; we don't have an outtake, but we do have the words, on a handwritten lyric sheet titled "The New Fast Song (Candy)". He took the first verse of "Candy's Boy", the second verse from the "Fast Song", lines from "Frankie", and fresh lyrics (i.e. "we kiss", instead of "I got caught" at the start of Max's drum roll). The third verse was mainly adapted from "The Fast Song". The lyrics contain several lines that did not survive to the album track V5. "I get visions of avenging angels of eden with their white horses and flaming swords can blow this whole town into the sea" is from "God's Angels-Fast Song", and "they cant touch Candy and me, our love they cannot destroy, I will forever be Candy's boy" is mostly from "Candy's Boy". According to author Clinton Heylin, the band worked on this extensively over the next two days. Of great interest is the film clip shot by Barry Rebo from September 30, 1977, which appeared on the Thrill Hill Vault DVD/Blu-ray of The Promise: The Darkness On The Edge Of Town Story box set. It is a short segment, with Bruce and Jon Landau at the Record Plant, as Bruce plays for Jon new lyrics he has written for "Candy's Room Demo" V4; these are entirely different, and describe a magical house at the edge of town, with Candy waiting for him in the window. The date here is also from Sony Archives, which shows another take on December 12, 1977, and then a marathon overdub-mixing session, from March 3 to March 5, 1978, which finally concluded when take 42 (v5b) was selected for Darkness On The Edge Of Town.

DANCING IN THE DARK - V2c - dub mix	5:30	1984 EP
Note: The last song on Born In The U.S.A. to be recorded. Written in no time at all after Jon Landau convinced Bruce that the album needed a single. According to Dave Marsh in Glory Days, Bruce was not impressed with Landau's approach. "Look", he snarled, "I've written seventy songs. You want another one, you write it." Despite this reaction, Bruce sat in his hotel room and wrote the song in a single night. It sums up his state of mind, his feeling of isolation after the success of The River, and his frustrations of trying to write a hit-single. Six takes cut on February 14, 1984 at The Hit Factory, then 58 mixes, completed on March 8. V1a contains a longer sax solo at the end that was shortened (cut) for the official album version. V2a thru V2c are dance/disco remixes done at The Power Station in April or early May 1984 by Arthur Baker. The recording engineer for the remixes was Chris Lord-Alge. These remixes were released on June 29, 1984. The 7" and 12" singles were released on May 9, 1984, and the 12" finished as the biggest selling in the U.S.A. that year.

DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN - V3a	4:23	ODM / HOD / UP / AM
DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN - V3b	4:23	DARKNESS / ESSENTIAL: 2003 / GH09
Note: Bruce began writing "Darkness On The Edge Of Town" right after "Born To Run", according to a 1978 interview. Down in the Alternative Album Sequence-section, you can see "Darkness" listed on the first two 1976 'album' sequences Springsteen prepared, supporting his recollection. V1 represents multiple takes reported at Bruce's home, Telegraph Hill, Holmdel, New Jersey, during 1976, even though the odds of recovering any material seem low at this time. Then again, few were aware that Barry Rebo had the film footage released from the Thrill Hill Vault on Blu-Ray/DVD No. 2 from The Promise: The Darkness On The Edge Of Town Story box set. No doubt Bruce and the E Street Band worked extensively on "Rendezvous", "Something In the Night", "The Promise", "Frankie", "Candy's Boy", and "Darkness". Music and some lyrics written by February 1976, was sub-titled "The Racer" for a time. Though it is listed on the 'Star Wars' demo tape of June 1, 1977, pictured below, V2a was not cut until June 6. V2b is the full length, speed corrected version. Sony logs show takes recorded on June 8, 9, 20 and 23, 1977 at Atlantic Studios. Work on the lyrics was needed. Then, after putting forth such a good effort (5 days), Bruce put "Darkness" aside for the rest of the year. It was not included on the 'Badlands' album sequence from October, or the January 16, 1978 seq. On March 8, he suddenly called his forces together, and over three days, they re-recorded "Darkness" from scratch and completed what would become the title track of the album. The March takes were cut in a studio with bare concrete walls, after the room was gutted prior to renovation. V3a and V3b are the album track recording, with a slight difference. V3a can be identified by the addition of the word "ready" to the line "I'll be there on time ready to pay the cost". V3b is mix take #28 from March 30, 1978, and was pressed to metal acetate on April 12.

COME ON (LET'S GO TONIGHT) - V7	2:16	PROMISE
Note: "Come On (Let’s Go Tonight)" was written in the Spring of 1977, and V1 was cut on June 1, 1977, complete with Vox [organ], at Atlantic Studios, on the first night of the Darkness sessions. The band picked up the rhythm quickly, but Bruce had much work to do on the lyrics. V2 is the earliest take we have in circulation, a rough workout, from either July 2 or 13 at Atlantic Studios, but further progress was needed on the lyrics. At this point, Bruce had written, "Everybody wants heaven, but nobody wants to die, Come on, come on, lets go tonight". Two out of three verses had "death in their eyes". "Come On (Let's Go Tonight)" V3 represented a sudden shift; though it retained it's name (Sony logs show all sessions to the end of 1977 under this name), the lyrics were radically rewritten to the story of Douglas Springsteen, Bruce's father, who worked at a machine factory under harsh conditions. An interview quoted Bruce, "I remember my old man was working in this plastics factory… and all I remember, when we used to go in that place, was him standing near 'em loud fucking machines". Now he sang "Factory takes his hearing, but he understands", but the third verse was the outcome of working under these conditions, "somebody's gonna get hurt tonight". It is possible that Bruce worked with both ideas for a while, but after September, all energies went toward "The Factory Song", though it was not named this until January 2, 1978. Sessions took place on August 23, 24 and 30, and September 8, 1977 at the Record Plant. Roy Bittan played his piano Floyd Cramer style to give it a Chet Atkins produced-country feel, and an organ was not in the mix at this point. V4-V5 from November 2, 7, and 8, and December 9, 27, 1977 features violin overdubs by David Lindley, a well-known musician who played with Jackson Browne (December 9 most-likely date for Lindley). V7, released on the The Promise: The Darkness On The Edge Of Town Story box set in 2010, is the finished take of "Come On (Let's Go Tonight)", with a fresh 2010 violin added, again by Lindley. The vocal is vintage, but the recording date has not been determined, and it is unknown if there is a finished 1977 version of "Come On" with Lindley. V6 was the result of overdub/mixing sessions on March 10 and 14, 1978, all at the Record Plant. The 1978 sessions were under the name "The Factory Song". Danny recorded new organ tracks, which featured prominently in the final album version 6b. Bruce recorded new vocals, and changed, "Factory takes his hearing, but he understands" to "Factory takes his hearing, factory gives him life". V6c is mix take 28 from April 3, 1978, and it was pressed to metal acetate with the title "Factory Song" on April 12, 1978.
What ever happened to "Come On (Let's Go Tonight)"? In March 1981, Bruce wrote new music and recorded a demo at his home in Colts Neck, NJ with the original name. However, he decided to rearrange it once more, combining several lines with new verses, and the first two lines from Chuck Berry's 'Bye Bye Johnny', to create "Johnny Bye-Bye".

Note: V1 is a work-in-progress version from late 1979, recorded at Telegraph Hill, listed as "Slow Fade" in the Lost Masters liner notes, but it bears no resemblance to that song, which is known from February 1980 Telegraph Hill rehearsals. V2 recorded at The Power Station on March 9 and 15-17, as well as April 9 and 29, 1980. All appear to be different mix permutations of the same basic recording. V2a is described as "end tag intercut number two, dry voice fade, loud last line" by the engineer. V2b appears to be an aborted mix, "the take after the last one, 28". V2c is take #26, V2d is take #'27 with less piano. Released as single 1981, B-side was BE TRUE.

FIRE - V1	5:14	LM-2 / DDO / DO-2 / MT1 / AM
FIRE - V2	4:05	PROMISE
Note: Written in May 1977, a few days after Bruce and Steve attended an Elvis Presley concert in Philadelphia. V1 (which is not a final take) comes from June 17, 1977 at Atlantic Studios. Introducing the song on November 20, 1978 in Champaign, IL, Bruce said "This is a song I wrote, oh, we jammed it up in the studio one night in twenty minutes". Allegedly (and this may be myth) a finished demo take was sent to Elvis Presley in July or August 1977, shortly before his death, with the hope that Elvis might cover it. Bruce ended up donating the song to Robert Gordon, who recorded his cover (with Bruce on piano) in early December 1977 (released April 1978). The Pointer Sisters then quickly covered Gordon's released version and had a major international hit in early 1979. The officially released V2 was partly recorded in 1977, and partly recorded in 2010.

V2 was recorded in John Hammond's office on May 2, 1972, and V3 was cut the next day at Columbia Studio E for his Columbia audition tape, and V3b was officially released 26 years later on 'Tracks'. V4 was an acoustic take, recorded without the band at the first Greetings session on June 7, 1972, and does not circulate. V5 was cut on June 27, 1972, and V6, the final take from that session, was chosen for release on 'Greetings'.

Note: Recorded with Brendan O'Brien at Southern Tracks Studios, Atlanta, during the Working On A Dream sessions in 2008, which formed the basis of the released track, along with additional parts by the E Street Band, recorded on later dates. Considered for High Hopes in 2013, but was among the several tracks not selected, prompting Springsteen to release American Beauty, a 12" vinyl EP on RSD April 19, 2014, and digitally on April 22. The presence of Patrick Warren and lyrical content helps confirm that this recording (or at least part of it) emanates from Atlanta.

HUNGRY HEART - V1h	3:15	RIVER / 1980 Single / ESSENTIAL / GREATEST
Note: Apparently penned after Joey Ramone asked Bruce to write a song for the Ramones after he attended a Ramones show at The Fast Lane in Asbury Park in March 1979; this may be apocryphal. In any case, Springsteen has confirmed that it was written with the Ramones in mind, and was considering giving the song away. He played it for Jon Landau, who convinced Bruce to keep it for himself. The eight takes listed above all appear to be different mixes of the same basic performance that are also running at varying tape speeds. The version released on The River has been pitch adjusted, raising the pitch of Springsteen's vocal to achieve a more radio friendly sound. V1b is the backing track only. V1f has heavy echo added to Springsteen's vocal. Recorded at The Power Station on 14 and 21 June and September 5, 1979 with further mixing or overdub sessions on March 24 and April 10, 1980. Flo & Eddie (Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan of the Turtles) contribute backing vocals.
Further work on this song was undertaken at The Power Station on March 24 and April 10, 1980. Likely a mixing or overdub session, perhaps for Flo and Eddie's backing vocals.

I'LL STAND BY YOU ALWAYS - V2b	5:29	O&S
I'LL STAND BY YOU - V2c	4:35	BLINDED: OST
I'LL STAND BY YOU - V2d	3:01	BLINDED: MOVIE
Note: A ballad written by Springsteen sometime between 1998 and 2000, inspired by reading the Harry Potter books to his youngest son Sam. This is not a children's song, however. Sometime in early 2001, Bruce made the song available to director Chris Columbus, who at the time was shooting the first of the Potter movies. However, the Springsteen song was ultimately rejected due to Harry Potter novelist/creator JK Rowling's contractual stipulation, that no commercial songs of any type be used in the Potter film series. Warner Bros Music President Gary Lemel, who was involved in the Potter music, was asked for comment by USA Today, but said he preferred not to comment publicly – but in doing so seemingly verified the basic truth in the story. In September or October 2001, Springsteen donated the song to fellow Sony artist (and Latin/Salsa star) Marc Anthony, who recorded a cover version. In late 2001 both Sony and Anthony issued press releases specifically promoting the Springsteen composition and mentioning it would be one of the tracks on Anthony's forthcoming album Mended (and likely the lead single off the album). Strangely, when the Mended album was finally released in April 2002, the song was not on the album, nor was it issued as a single. A later special edition of Mended with bonus tracks also didn't include the song. There has been no explanation as to why the Springsteen composition was not issued. V1 is from early 2001, a rough demo version, with very few lyrics written. However, Bruce finished them quickly, and recorded the completed studio version V2a on January 28, 2001 at '40 Bellevue Studio", in the building next to his Rumson home. The studio version "I'll Stand By You" was exclusively given out on an in-house promo CD-R to some very few top executives at Columbia Records. The CD-R was burned on Oct 31, 2001, right around the time when the track was being offered up to the Harry Potter producers, and about a week before the Live In New York City DVD was released. The CD-R contains three tracks: "Song For Harry Potter", "My Hometown (Live)", and "This Hard Land (Live)". V2b is the probably the same studio recording, copyrighted on June 13, 2001 and apparently donated to the Harry Potter movie. This version uses a similar base track, but the lyrics are completed. It leaked on February 10, 2017. In late 2018, Ron Aniello added overdubs and effects. It was mixed by Bob Clearmountain on February 19, 2019 at Stone Hill Studio, Colts Neck, NJ, specifically for the Blinded by The Light soundtrack album, and released August 9, 2019. v2c is actually the same as v2b, but fades out 50 seconds earlier, features more backing vocals, and the mix is a bit different. It was produced by Ron Aniello and mastered by Bob Ludwig. Aniello is also credited as engineer and mixing engineer, Toby Scott is credited as engineer (2001), and Rob Lebret is credited as engineer and mixing engineer. v2d is the clip used in the film, identical to v2c, but fades out after 3:00.

Note: Nobody bought The Wild, The Innocent until after "Born To Run" came out, but forty years later, it is not uncommon to read a review describing side two as one of the greatest in rock and roll history, an operetta, a masterpiece. It starts with "Incident on 57th Street", then a piano segue into "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)", and finally "New York City Serenade". "Incident" was composed in 1973, with an early title, "Incident On the W. Side" V1. It was the last song recorded, on September 22-23, 1973, the latter Springsteen's 24th birthday, the final days of sessions.

Note: V1 and V2 were recorded at Pocketful of Tunes, 39 West 55th Street, New York, NY on February 14, 1972, at Bruce's audition for Mike Appel and Jim Cretecos. Bruce started off with a new song, "It's Hard to Be a Saint in the City", which was performed a second time at the request of Appel, who was dazzled by the lyrics. V3 was performed at John Hammond's office, CBS Records, 51 West 52nd Street, New York, NY on May 2, 1972. V4 recorded at Studio E Columbia Records building, 6th floor, 49 East 52nd Street, New York City on May 3, 1972 and officially issued on Tracks. V5 likely recorded at Pocketful Of Tunes Studios, New York, NY in May-June, 1972. V6a was recorded on June 26, 1972, and V6b mixed the following day, June 27. The only difference is that Bruce’s vocal on V6b is faded out several seconds earlier than in V6a, which reveals that there were a few “street rapping” words spoken by Bruce that were cut from the officially released version. V6c is the final album track after overdubbing and mixing on October 26.

** Janey Needs a Shooter

JANEY NEEDS A SHOOTER - V2	4:30	uncirculating
JANEY NEEDS A SHOOTER - V3	1:34	LM-8

JANEY NEEDS A SHOOTER - V5	6:50	DDO / DO-1 / EC / ATMF
JANEY NEEDS A SHOOTER - V6	6:43	LETTER
Note: "Janey Needs A Shooter" has a long, complicated history. V1 was recorded in a solo piano arrangement at 914 Sound Studios, Blauvelt, NY, on January 29, 1973, with additional takes on January 30. The lyrics were written during 1972, although the melody was culled from the mid-1971 Springsteen composition "Talking About My Baby", a recording of which exists, from a show in Richmond, VA in October 1971. "Janey Needs A Shooter" appeared on provisional lists for The Wild, The Innocent & The E Street Shuffle, but did not make the final cut. Also listed on the earliest known album #3 sequence, from spring 1974. Session log documents indicate that a full-band arrangement was recorded at 914 Sound Studios at some point during the Born To Run sessions, but it was bypassed for the album.

V3 and V4 are acoustic demos Bruce recorded around March–April 1979, at Telegraph Hill. V5 is a magnificent full band recording originally attributed to the Darkness On The Edge Of Town sessions, and later to the October 1978 rehearsal session at Telegraph Hill, Holmdel, NJ. Given the evidence (including audio not circulating), we can confirm it is a Telegraph Hill rehearsal from May 1979. The quality of the private audio is far superior to that found on the 'Definitive Darkness Outtakes' or 'Iceman' CDs, and includes the count-in and runs at the correct speed. "Janey Needs A Shooter" was also included on a very early tracklist for what became The River, but in all likelihood never seriously considered.

Warren Zevon has said that he became obsessed with the title line after Jon Landau mentioned it along with other songs that Springsteen was intending to record. Zevon pestered Bruce, pleading to hear the song. Bruce agreed, and he ended up working on his own version of the song, his interpretation of "Jeannie Needs A Shooter" (he had misheard the name), and played an incomplete version to Bruce sometime in the spring of 1979. Springsteen loved the arrangement, and they wrote the remainder of "Jeannie Needs A Shooter" together. The Zevon/Springsteen version is "a romantic saga of an outlaw pursuing a maiden while her father tries to gun him down," the opposite of Springsteen's original. Zevon's studio take of "Jeannie Needs A Shooter" from the Bad Luck Streak In Dancing School album was recorded during the summer of 1979 and released in February 1980.

V6 was the earliest track recorded for Letter To You, and was initially intended for release on Record Store Day, as Bruce confirmed during a phone call to E Street Radio on October 23, 2020.

flickr:40278488542
Note: The first circulating live performance of "Jungleland" is from July 12, 1974, although the May 9 show at the Harvard Square Theatre, Cambridge, MA may be the actual debut. There is a good quality soundboard from the July 12 show, a test recording stopped by Mike Appel after 'Kitty's Back' and 'Jungleland' were complete. The song at this juncture is confused, sounding like a mini jazz opera, and David Sancious has still got Bruce under his 'New York City Serenade' spell. The song resolves itself quite differently, "the girls cry … in Port Authority halls, In the tunnel of machines they’ll hear the screams drowned out by the roarin’ train…The Rat reappears on Flamingo Lane, Then an angel rises from the sands and disappears down in Jungleland". Fortunately, the peyote wore off, Sancious and drummer Boom Carter gave their notice and moved on. But on August 1, before David and Ernest left, this is the version 2 that the E Street Band set out to record. However, he has already starting playing with that final verse, evidently unhappy with it. So the coloured girls are now jungle girls, and the Magic Rat reappears just in time to save the barefoot girl "from the edge of an on-coming train". The take borders on ridiculous, but Springsteen would use the same modus operandi when recording 'Backstreets', using meaningless lines where the lyrics were still unwritten. These lines were gone by the end of October.

V1 of the studio record was from January 8, 1974, a rehearsal session at 914 Sound Studios, Blauevelt, New York. At present, no audio or lyric sheets exist for this session. On August 1, 1974, V2 is a complete take (described above), known to exist from this session (see illustration), but audio has yet to be released. Bruce continued to play Jungleland live, and in the studio; V4 was attempted on October 17, along with V3, the famous 1:33 segment of Bruce and Suki Lahav recording vocals for dubbing, has been dated to 1974 because of the presence of Suki, who left United States permanently in March 1975. Here she is talking live to Bruce and singing the song coda with heavy echo. Roy Bittan also plays piano. This is the last known circulating studio audio, until sessions resumed at the Record Plant on April 18, 1975. Peter Knobler’s 1975 Crawdaddy profile describes one evening at 914 when ‘they spent until 4 a.m. playing “Jungleland” … fourteen times straight through. Inevitably, someone would blow a line and the entire take would be shot.’ After the October 17 studio take, the original final verse, described above, was largely rewritten, now looking much like the final album track. He would not keep the jazz solo or the section, "hear the animals sing oh oh oh"; the chimes would last until March 1975, but they were gone by the Record Plant sessions.

For the second half of 1974 and the first half of 1975, second verse lines like, "there’s a crazy kind of light tonight, brighter than the one that sparkles for prophets" survived, until they were changed in July 1975 to, "The midnight gang's assembled and picked a rendezvous for the night". Another, that had the exact same life span, was "The streets alive with tough-kid Jets in Nova-light machines, boys flash guitars like bayonets and rip holes in their jeans", until it became, "The street's alive as secret debts are paid, contacts made, they vanished unseen, Kids flash guitars just like switch-blades hustling for the record machine". He also changed the bridge and the final verse, "In the tunnel of machines you’ll hear the screams drowned out by the trains"; by late October 1974, it became "In the tunnel of machines the magic Rat chases his dreams", and finally Bruce got brave at the Record Plant, "In the tunnels uptown, the Rat's own dream guns him down", killed by the runaway American dream. After Sancious left, the three new members, Roy Bittan, Max Weinberg and Suki Lahav, quickly asserted themselves into Jungleland, joining Bruce, Clarence, Garry and Danny seemlessly, bringing the song to new heights. Bruce obviously devoted major blocks of time arranging Jungleland, utilizing his new players. The E Street Band lost it's jazz sound, and became a solid rock and roll band.

Jon Landau moved the BTR sessions to the Record Plant on April 18, 1975, where the other circulating outtakes emanate from. Sessions resumed without Suki, who had returned to Israel after her last show in March, with her husband, engineer Louis Lahav, who was replaced by Jimmy Iovine. Suki would appear on "Born To Run" by overdubs of her violin and background vocals. Much of the first day was devoted to Jungleland, heard in V5, and with the band recording base tracks. V6 has the same opening as v5, but after that uses the guide vocal by Bruce, strings and no sax, also in V7. Studio logs show V5-7 were all recorded between April 18 and April 25, 1975. V8 is the final version being overdubbed on July 14, lacking a lead guitar track, with different vocals, but the lyrics are now done. Final takes for V9, the album track, came down to the last minute on July 20, according to Bruce, "Clarence and I finishing the “Jungleland” sax solo, phrase by phrase, in one (room), while we mixed “Thunder Road” in another, singing “Backstreets” in a third as the band rehearsed (for the Tour that was to begin that evening) in a spare room upstairs".

This is the song where Springsteen shows he has learned how to paint a scene lyrically and musically, and situate the listener at the heart of it. It took him sixteen months to write, refine, and record it. He went through take after take, saying “again,” “again,” “again,” as he sought something he found only by experimenting with various musical styles. He will never again write a song this long, this character-laden, or this operatic. It begins with violin by Suki Lahav, dubbed from 914 Sound Studios, which sets the elegiac tone for the song. Then a tinkling piano carries us to the first verse. In the second verse, the organ joins in at “churches to the jails.” Springsteen's writing technique uses dualism to paint the landscape, "hungry and hunted"; "what’s flesh and what’s fantasy". He places us into the heart of the action, when "we take our stand down in Jungleland". In the third verse, Springsteen turns the scene into a rock ’n’ roll West Side Story, “An opera out on the Turnpike, a ballet being fought out in the alley.” “Jungleland” is a “real death waltz" where "Kids flash guitars just like switch-blades" Musically, this is where there is a key shift in the song as Springsteen shouts rather than sings “The hungry and the hunted explode into rock’n’roll bands." Then "They face off against each other out in the street down in Jungleland" leads us into a guitar solo by Bruce, refined by a year of performances. The he pans out for the bridge, four lines that describe other parts of the movie for us, and leads us into the non-verbal part of the tale, where we are carried away by a sax solo by Clarence Clemmons, the high point of his career, that lasts more than two minutes. When we return to earth, the rat and the barefoot girl are in bed, and their "two hearts beat", just as Spanish Johnny and Puerto Rican Jane's had in another great song. Finally "In the tunnels uptown, the Rat's own dream guns him down", but that is not the end. Springsteen pans out again, changing chords and keys, "Outside the street’s on fire in a real death waltz", but then switching up to a piano-and-violin chord that fades into silence, as the poets "try to make an honest stand", but they "wind up wounded, not even dead tonight in Jungleland". With cries like a wolf howling, accompanied by piano and violin, “Jungleland” comes to a close. The howls were improvised (he never did this in all the live performances), but Landau recalls that when he heard them he knew that had to be how the record ended.

Note: Written during mid-1973. In 1974 Bruce mentioned he got the idea for the title from a neon sign promoting the return of popular stripper’s show to a local Shore-area club. Base track was recorded June 28, 1973 with overdubs on July 11, 24 and September 23. David Sancious has mentioned in interviews that the organ solo on this track is his, and we can presume it was added at one of the three later sessions. The final product reflects the song writing and arranging skills of Bruce, with help from Sancious. It spent the rest of the decade in the live set. One of the final songs completed for the album. All versions are slightly different mixes or recordings, V1-V4 could be from any or all of the recording dates confirmed.

Note: Not written by Bruce until late April or May 1975; the working title was "The Heist", and that was utilized even on test pressing of the album. V1 contains just piano and vocal, features some different words and may be Bruce’s original guide demo. V2 (take 14), V3 (take 15) and V5 (take 18) are short, aborted takes. V4 (take 16) and V6 (take 19) are work-in-progress versions with alternate horn arrangements. All were recorded on May 28, 1975 as "The Heist" with top session musician Randy Brecker on trumpet. Included on July 2 final and July 7 revised-final album sequences, thanks to Mike Appel, who fought tooth and nail to keep it on the album; Bruce wanted Linda Let Me Be the One. The final album mixing sessions were on July 18, 1975.

Note: Two different, complete, recordings on separate cassettes were made on May 25, 1982, over five months after the vast majority of the Nebraska tracks were cut. Only one take has surfaced (three mixes). V1 and V2a do not include any synthesizer (the synthesizer was likely added at The Power Station). V2b includes an additional 28 seconds of synthesizer at the end that was cut from the official release. The master tape for this longer version was accidentally sent to Japan in 1985 and released on the first-ever CD print run of the album, as well as a second pressing of the Japanese CD in 1986/87. The long version was also utilized on original 1986/87 export editions of the Japanese CD sent to Europe and the USA. The mistake was eventually corrected on all versions. The long version has not been officially available anywhere since 1995. Some early promotional copies of the album sent to press and radio stations (certainly in the UK, and perhaps worldwide) also included the synth coda.

Note: Written in late 1982 as a rockabilly song called "Your Hometown", with
many of the album version lyrics finished by late January 1983. V1-V4 were early
takes recorded by Bruce and Toby Scott at his new home, at 7965 Fareholm Drive,
Los Angeles, California 90046, on January 29 and 30, and February 9 and
17, 1983. The demos are of good quality, probably prepared to aid in teaching
the song to the band. Instead, Bruce set it aside for a few months, and came
back with a new title, "My Hometown", and an arrangement for the band. On June
29, 1983 at The Hit Factory, four complete takes were recorded, but the first
two were discarded because they both exceeded six minutes. Takes 3 and 4, which
both featuring Ruth Jackson (wife of sound engineer Bruce Jackson) on background
vocals, were the finalists, with take 3 V7 chosen for Born In The U.S.A..

NEW YORK CITY SONG - V1		uncirculating
NEW YORK CITY SERENADE - V2	9:58	PS / EY / SA914 / GT / ROOI
NEW YORK CITY SERENADE - V3	9:53	WIESS
Note: "New York Song" aka "New York City Song", was composed in 1972, and played live from January 3 - June 2, 1973. It was recorded on May 31, 1973 at Alpha Sound Studios, Richmond, Virginia for live broadcast on WGOE-FM, and can be found on Über Series Vol 22. On June 22, V1 was recorded for Album #2 at 914 Sound Studios, Blauvelt, New York. In the following week, an idea to combine it with elements of "Vibes Man", another 1972 composition, was hatched, and "New York City Serenade" V2 was recorded on June 28, 1973. Blame or credit has been assigned to David Sancious, who made the arrangement suggestions, though he tried to side-step by saying ‘I don’t think they constituted the arrangement.’ On July 18, 1973, it was performed live at Max's Kansas City, New York, where Sancious added the West Side Story piano introduction. V3 (presumably overdubbed on August 7) includes the addition of strings, group vocals and congas.

NIGHT - V1	2:55	ESRR / BTRS
NIGHT - V2	2:51	WAR / VAFH / BWNH / BTRS
NIGHT - V3 - take 8	2:57	BORN TO RUN
Note: Ten takes recorded at the Record Plant on May 10, 1975. Take 8 was marked 'Great - Hold', which suggest this one was the recording used for Born To Run. The three recordings above are all different performances. V1 is core rhythm track with guide vocal and guitar, recorded at 914 Sound Studios, Blauvelt, NY in early August 1974. V2 includes double tracked vocals, and was recorded at the Record Plant in April 1975. Included in a possible album sequence of late-autumn 1974. First line of the song was re-used from Springsteen's Steel Mill composition "Oh Mama", from 1970.

NIGHT FIRE - V3	0:30	DROC2
NIGHT FIRE - V4	1:36	DROC2
NIGHT FIRE - V5	4:44	RIVER: OUTTAKES
Note: According to author Clinton Heylin, Springsteen adapted the music of "In The City Tonight", which the band practiced extensively on March 25, 1979. Five days later, he had re-arranged it as a hard rocking song, "Into the Night", named "Night Fire" on the subsequent takes. V1-V5 are from the Telegraph Hill Studios on March 30, 1979. V3 is a partial take of an instrumental section. V4 is Bruce and Clarence working on the saxophone solo. V1 is a complete take (running faster than V2-4), that for some reason is listed as "Untitled Song #2" on E. St. Records' 'Definitive River Outtakes Collection Vol 2', and "Into the Night" on River Refineries Revisited (better sound!), but might be the best "Night Fire" of all-time. V2 is also a complete take, slower but still hard rocking, without the piano and guitar overdubs of V1. V5 was recorded at The Power Station on June 13, 1979, slower than the rehearsals with a "Because The Night"-style piano introduction. Unfortunately, modern vocals were overdubbed over what sounds like vintage backing. Included on a 1993 in-house Tracks concept album.

PHANTOMS - V5	5:37	DDITV / MT1 / ROOI / SA914
ZERO AND BLIND TERRY - V6	5:54	TRACKS
Note: "Phantoms", also known by the titles "Over The Hills Of St. George" and "Over The Hills Of St. Croix", was written during early 1973, and apparently performed live several times during May and June, notably including the sole recorded performance on June 13 at Binghampton, NY. Sony logs during The Wild, The Innocent sessions show "Phantoms" was worked on June 22 and 26: this produced V1, the backing track of both final studio tracks of "Phantoms" and "Zero And Blind Terry" (also dubbed "Wild Zero And Blind Terry" out in bootleg world later on). V2, an alternate and unreleased instrumental take, was also recorded on one or both of these dates. Up until June 28, these takes were referred to as "Phantoms"; at that session, vocal tracks and instrumentation were added to V1 for both "Phantoms" V3, and "Zero and Blind Terry" V4, completing each. But on July 1, 1973, Bruce added additional dubs to Phantoms V3, making V5 the final take. The date of the circulating version is either June 28 or July 1. "Zero and Blind Terry" was first played live on July 18, 1973 at Max's Kansas City, New York, NY. Sony studio logs only mention "Zero" on June 28 and August 7, 1973. V1, the unreleased backing track sometimes called "Wild Zero" by bootleggers, but never called "Phantoms", except in the Official Sony logs we rely on. Along with V2, a shorter, alternate backing track that was not used, it is reasonable to assume one or both were recorded June 22 and June 26, 1973, any number of times, under the name "Phantoms" only. The first take logged of "Zero and Blind Terry" did not occur until June 28, the rock on which these statements are made. Then the studio logs list one or more takes of both of our titles on June 28, 1973, which we designate as the never heard V3 (Phantoms), and the standard version of "Zero" V4. It was pressed to acetate, used as the publishing demo, but not included on album #2. It has circulated on various boots for many years, much loved by collectors and hardcore fans. According to the Tracks session data, V6, the version on the 1998 collection, comes from the June 28 session. The logs show the June 28 version was referenced on November 5, 1997, but we could not identify the source and dates of the overdubs applied to the version on Tracks. Sancious's piano was certainly not recorded on June 28, nor were the backing vocals by Suki Lahav. The June 28 basic track was sent out as a publishing demo, in an early mix from June 28 or earlier. An overdubbed flute that had been removed by June 28 was still there. Most, and possibly all of the overdubs described here were done by and included in the August 7 session, mixed and stored away with the invisible title of V6, never circulating until being released on Tracks. Suki Lahav is also credited in the Tracks booklet. Statements referring to "Phantoms" as an early or work-in-progress version of "Zero And Blind Terry" are incorrect. These are two different songs, with no overlapping lyrics.

Note: Two acoustic takes were recorded around January 3, 1982 at Springsteen's home in Colts Neck, NJ. "Pink Cadillac" was one of the few songs from the acoustic Nebraska not to be recorded with the band in the May 1982 sessions at the Power Station, but V3 was recorded on May 31, 1983 at The Hit Factory in New York. Officially released in May 1984 as the b-side to "Dancing In The Dark". V3b has the complete ending, V3c is a mono mix that for some reason was only issued on the Japanese single. Included on a 1984 album artwork prototype, in place of both "No Surrender" and "I'm Goin' Down". Interestingly, the song was copyrighted on April 7, 1983, almost two months before the Hit Factory session. V4 is the duet version recorded for Jerry Lee Lewis's 2006 album Last Man Standing. For a bizarre footnote, see the 1983 Bette Midler incident.

POINT BLANK - V5 - take 12	5:17	DROC1 / RO / ATMF
POINT BLANK - V6	5:59	RIVER
Note: Initially written during the early stages of the Darkness Tour, Bruce confirmed in a 1978 interview that "Point Blank" was composed during soundcheck at the Music Hall in Boston in late May. Unfortunately, there were no studio sessions at this time, so no recordings exist. Premiered live at The Roxy Theatre in Hollywood on July 7, 1978 and played regularly once the song returned to the setlist two months later. Both the lyrics and arrangement are quite different to the final take on The River.

V1 is an acoustic demo from around January-June 1979 and consists of harmonies and guitar practice. V2-V5 are takes 3, 9, 11, and 12 respectively, all recorded on the same night at The Power Station on May 29 and 30, 1979. These four takes feature a completely different, faster, rocking arrangement with alternative lyrics to both the 1978 live versions and the eventual River release. The mid-section includes a searing guitar solo. V6, the final arrangement, contains a newly written, extended narrative middle section and was recorded some months later, possibly on August 23 and 25, 1979, or February 16, 1980.

PROVE IT ALL NIGHT - V2b	3:54	ODM / HOD / UP / AM
PROVE IT ALL NIGHT - V2c	3:54	DARKNESS / ESSENTIAL: 2015 / 1978 SINGLE
Note: Bruce came up with the title, "Prove It All Night", and says he adapted "It's A Shame" aka "Jon's Jam", (which was written, recorded and set aside in June), but the lyrics were a work in progress when he arrived at the Record Plant on September 12, 1977. He later said (live as an intro to the song) "that he got the idea from a cabbie, who was moanin' about having to prove it to your boss and your wife everyday". The E Street Band learned the chords quickly, and to go ahead and record a take, Bruce had worked up a lyric sheet using the first verse from "Something In The Night", V1 released on the 'Lost Masters Volume III'. Work continued on September 14, 15 and 16, completed with V2 (take 49), mixed in Spring 1978 by Toby Scott, Chuck Plotkin's Chief Engineer. "Prove It All Night" never failed to be included on tentative album sequences, from October 1977 thru May 1978. Version 2a is an alternate mix that runs to a hard stop ending, with Max's energetic performance and danny's organ dominating. Version 2b features the vocal track above the organ and drums , and runs shorter. v2c was released as the first single, ahead of the album, on May 23, 1978 in the United States.

RACING IN THE STREET - V4a	6:16	LM-2 / DDO / DO-2 / UP / LMEC2 / DDOC / AM
RACING IN THE STREET ('78) - V4b	6:47	PROMISE
Note: Springsteen started writing "Racing In The Street" shortly after New Years Eve at the Tower Theatre, back in 1975, along with "Darkness On The Edge Of Town" and "The Promise", and court proceedings prevented him from working on it in a recording studio until July 1977. But after he moved into Telegraph Hill in the Summer of 1976, Bruce and the band practiced daily. Unfortunately, it seems that almost none of this was documented, except for Barry Rebo's films (100% owned by Bruce), and what can be inferred by studying the live shows. V1 was recorded July 2, 1977 at Atlantic Studios. According to the Lost Masters III liner notes, V2 was recorded in August 1977, and studio logs show takes on 8 different days at either Atlantic Studios or The Record Plant during the month. The comp. reel for the official album release V3b came on August 30, 1977. However, Bruce returned to his composition in V4a ,with an alternate band arrangement with wailing harmonica and tremendous vocal, recorded between November28 and 30, 1977 at The Record Plant. The officially released V4b, titled "Racing In The Street ('78)" on The Promise, utilizes a different 1977 vocal take and runs longer, but uses the V4 base tracks recorded at the end of November 1977, which have little in common with Racing Part I from August. David Lindley plays modern violin, as he did on "Come On", back in 1977. Work continued on December 6 and 9; studio logs also show mixing sessions at The Record Plant from March 21 thru 23, 1978. Mix take 46 went on Darkness. Bruce adapted the lines "summer's here and the time is right / for goin' racing in the street" from Martha and the Vandellas' "Dancing In The Street".

Note: At least four takes recorded at The Record Plant on September 12, 1977 and played once on the Darkness Tour on December 28, 1978 in Pittsburgh, PA. Re-recorded for The River. A song titled "Rocker" was registered with the US Copyright Office in January 2011 but information on the copyright claim suggests this is actually "Ramrod". It was registered because a short audio snippet was included in The Promise: The Making Of Darkness On The Edge Of Town, the documentary included on the box set. It can be heard at exactly 1:00.00. All of the above are mix variations of different vocal takes over the same basic recording. There is also some variation in tape speed. V2c is an overdub of Springsteen's guitar over the instrumental ending, V2i is several variations of Clarence's overdubbed saxophone, also over the instrumental ending. Recorded at The Power Station on June 12, 1979. Further recordings or mixing sessions (possibly overdubs) took place on August 27 and September 5, 1979, as well as much later in the sessions on April 4 and 19, 1980. Selected for an August 1979 album sequence.

RENDEZVOUS - V1 	2:47 	DDO / DO-3 / LES / MT1 / AM
RENDEZVOUS - V2 		uncirculating
RENDEZVOUS - V3 	2:36 	PROMISE

Note: The same night Springsteen introduced "Something In the Night" at the Monmouth County Arts Center, Red Bank, NJ, he also played "Rendezvous" for the first time. It was played fifty times between August 1, 1976 and March 25, 1977. When the Darkness sessions began on June 1, it was one of the ten songs recorded that evening, and additional takes were logged on June 2, 3, 8 and 17, 1977, all at Atlantic Studios. One of these was V1, an otherwise good take, but the audio is marred by a vocal drop-out during the first verse. "Rendezvous" was not played again during the sessions, and not included on the album. In a 1978 interview, Springsteen said the song was kept off because it didn’t fit thematically. Bruce personally demonstrated it to Greg Kihn in October 1978, who soon after recorded a cover (released in April 1979). A live-version was used for Tracks, which may indicate Bruce wasn't satisfied with the available studio versions. V3, officially released on The Promise, has lead vocals recorded July 18, 2010 at Stone Hill Studio, Rumson, New Jersey.

Note: V1 is an early acoustic demo from the first days of April 1979, after the Three Mile Island nuclear accident on March 28 that inspired the song. Sessions at The Power Station on April 3 and 4 with engineer Bob Clearmountain, produced multiple takes, which he worked on mixing as soon they were completed. Additional tracks, including new vocals, were recorded and overdubbed on April 11-12, 1980 by Neil Dorfsman. Chuck Plotkin and Toby Scott remixed numerous alternate versions, none of which made The River album. V2 is incomplete, with double-tracked lead vocals and a slower tempo. The lyrics show some variations to later versions, and the take was aborted, fading out during the guitar solo. V3 and V4 are different takes, the first song to be completed at the River sessions. V3 vocal is not finished, while V4 contains some interesting alternate words and changes, some more powerful than the officially available version. There are at least eight different mix variations in circulation, and more exist in private collections. The Tracks mix features more snare drum but less guitar than the mix found on the 1988 b-side to "One Step Up". Bruce states in his autobiography that "Roulette" was recorded shortly after the MUSE benefits of September 21 and 22, 1979, but all evidence indicates he is mistaken. In a 1998 interview with Mojo magazine, Springsteen said that ""Roulette" …would have been one of the best things on the record".

** Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)
*** Brucewiki - http://brucebase.wikidot.com/song:rosalita-come-out-tonight
**** On the tracks

ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) - V1	7:17	US5 / ET / ETRJ / ROOI / SA914
ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) - V2	7:00	WIESS / ESSENTIAL / GH09
Note According to Diane Lozito, Bruce's girlfriend 1971-1975, "he wrote 'Rosalita' in bits and pieces and didn't have a title for it," she says. "My mom is Rita Lozito. Then he met my grandma. So I assume that's where he put it together." Her grandmother's full name was "Rose Lozito"; In that part of Jersey, it's pronounced Lazita, so "Rose Lazita". Apparently, the derivation of the sub-title "(Come Out Tonight)" is by an unrelated and unknown process. Also according to Diane, and confirmed independently by her sister, Carol Lisa Lozito, though the song name came from her grandmother, the song was about Diane. Carol also said her sister was 'Crazey Janey" in "Spirit In the Night", "Sandy" in "4th of July, Asbury Park", "Terry" in "Backstreets", and the girl in "Thundercrack". This has never been refuted by Springsteen. In an interview for Mojo magazine published in January 1999, Springsteen told Mark Hagen that he wrote "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" as a live showstopper, just as he had written "Thundercrack" before it. Rosie was performed for the first time on February 14, 1973 at Richmond, Virginia, fully-formed musically, with plenty of lyrics too, though some were unfamiliar "with her chiffon reigns" and "soft sweet samurai tongue". It was performed live at least four more times, until it was recorded V2 on September 23, 1973 at 914 Sound Studios, Blauvelt, NY. Other than an instrumental backing track V1 from the same day, no other outtakes or alternates are known to exist.

SANTA ANA - V2		uncirculating
SANTA ANA - V3	4:50	UNE / PS / EY / US5 / SA914 / FOTF
SANTA ANA - V4	4:33	TRACKS
Note: 'Santa Ana' was also known as 'Hey Santa Ana', 'My Contessa', and 'The Guns of Kid Cole', thanks to creative or possibly erratic bootleggers. Written in late 1972 or early 1973, and performed live during 1973. Both V1 and V2 are early recordings from June 22 and 26, 1973, and remain uncirculated. V3 was recorded on June 28, 1973, and for many years was considered a complete, though unofficial, version. However, V4 released on Tracks, is an embellished mix, with overdubs added on July 1, 1973, including piano (David Sancious), a layer of acoustic guitar (Bruce), calypso percussion (Richard Blackwell) and Suki Lahav (vocals). The flute heard in V3 (courtesy of Clarence Clemons), has been entirely removed from V4. Mixing was done by Louis Lahav (1973) and Thom Panunzio (1997). Look for the lines "French cream won’t soften those boots, baby, French kisses will not break your heart"; since this track was never released, Bruce later put them to good use in "She’s the One".

SAVE MY LOVE V1	3:19	PROMISE: VAULT
SAVE MY LOVE V2	2:39	PROMISE / 2010 SINGLE
Note: V2 is a completely modern take of this song, recorded July 22, 2010 at Colts Neck, is included on The Promise. It appears it was never recorded in the studio. V1 is a summer 1976 band rehearsal filmed by Barry Rebo in Holmdel, NJ and is included on the Thrill Hill Vault DVD/Blu-ray on The Promise: The Darkness On The Edge Of Town Story box set.

Here is a reader's comment: hoping we eventually get more video of the band rehearsing, a la Save My Love '76 from Holmdel. For whatever reason, I find that stuff really fascinating. According to Thom Zimny there's a ton of rehearsal video still in the vault. Hope it eventually comes out.

Note: V1 was recorded for "Human Touch" but not utilized. In January 1995, Bruce re-recorded it at The Hit Factory, New York, during his reunion with the E Street Band. V2 is a combination of two brief snippets that was shown in the Blood Brothers video. V3 is a complete, alternate take, and V4 is prefaced by recording "take #1". V5a was released as a single, and included on the album, "Bruce Springsteen: Greatest Hits", released February 28, 1995. V5b features strings (courtesy David Kahn) added to V5a, and released November 19, 1996, on the official "Blood Brothers EP", as well as a single b-side in some countries. V5c, known as "the Jerry McGuire Remix", was produced by New York City radio station Z100 (with permission from Springsteen/Sony) as part of a spring 1997 listener contest promotion exclusive to that station. V5c features dialog excerpts from the movie added on top of the instrumental sections of the regular commercial version of the song. There are also additional, brief radio station plug spots before and after the song that are heard on this promo-only "contest giveaway" CD.

Acording to studio logs, the next take (V2) was recorded on May 4, 1975 at the Record Plant, New York, which was shorter and added lyrics in the final verse that were eventually used in "Backstreets". Conversely, Springsteen imported Contessa's beauty secrets from "Santa Ana"; "French cream won’t soften those boots, baby French kisses will not break your heart". On July 19, after all the tracks for Born to Run had been completed, Springsteen brought in a new 2nd verse and bridge, "and just one kiss she fills them long summer nights with her tenderness, that secret pact you made, back when her love could save you from the bitterness", completely changing the song from a fight with his girlfriend to a magical love song. Springsteen's vocal was added to complete the track V3 on July 25 for the album.

SOMETHING IN THE NIGHT - V2d	5:08	DARKNESS
Note: Premiered live on August 1, 1976 and was played at 31 of 54 shows on the Lawsuit Tour 1976-1977, which gave Springsteen opportunities to revise lyrics and modify arrangements. The tour featured a full-time horn section, the Miami Horns, and they were also used in several arrangements. When the Darkness sessions began on June 1, 1977, takes of "Something In the Night" were recorded that evening, and apparently the album take was chosen from these. According to Sony logs, there were two subsequent recording sessions on June 14 and 16, and that was it, until mixing sessions began in 1978. Versions 2a, 2b, 2c and 2d are all the same June 1 recording, with different mixes made. There is a posibility of V1 being recorded later in June on the dates mentioned. Godfatherecords release G.R. BOX 01, The Unbroken Promise: Lighting Up The Darkness Sessions, a 6 CD compilation of outtakes from the Darkness sessions, describes in it's extensive liner notes that ”Something In The Night appears in three versions, Version 2a being recorded in June-July 1977 at Atlantic Studios and versions 2b and 2c during September-October 1977." Unfortunately, there is no evidence at all of the latter. The final notation is Mix take #42 (V2d), from February 27, 1978, was pressed to metal acetate on April 12, 1978, and became track 3 on Darkness On the Edge of Town.

SONG FOR ORPHANS - V5	6:08	LETTER
Note: According to several authors, including Peter Ames Carlin (Bruce!) and Ryan White (Springsteen Album by Album), "Song To the Orphans" V1 was one of the songs Bruce Springsteen played for Mike Appel, following "Baby Doll", at their first meeting on November 4, 1971, at Pocketful of Tunes, 39 West 55th Street, New York, NY. It should also be noted neither Springsteen or Appel have confirmed or denied this in their writings to date. V2 recorded at Mediasound Studios, 311 West 57th Street, New York, NY, June–July 1972. V3 recorded at 914 Sound Studios on February 19, 1973, V4 recorded next day. Found on a proposed track-listing document for the Greetings album. First known live performance of "Song For Orphans" was on August 10, 1972 at Max's Kansas City, New York City, NY, and it was an occasional inclusion in Bruce’s opening solo segment during the first three months of the Greetings Tour. A couple of live audio performances from that period are circulating. Occasionally written as "Song To Orphans", "Song To The Orphans" and variations thereof. Although not considered for album #2, Springsteen composed several lists of songs in 1974, that were candidates for inclusion on his third album, and "Song For Orphans" made several. More information.... V5 was recorded over a five-day period in November 2019 at Stone Hill Studio, Colts Neck, New Jersey, with the E Street Band.

SOUTHERN SUN - V1	3:52	US3 / HDT / FOFC / RARITIES / DIHTSHN / EDR
SOUTHERN SUN - V2	4:15	BTF / UNE / US4 / DT / EDR
Note: Written as "It's A Southern Sun That Shines Down On This Yankee Boy" in late 1971-early 1972. V1 was recorded at Columbia Studios, Studio E, New York, NY on May 3, 1972. V2 recorded at Mediasound Studios, 311 West 57th Street, New York, NY in May-June, 1972. Original Sioux City Music documentation has the song titled as “Southern Sun”, but it was copyrighted under the incorrect title "Southern Son" in 1995 by JEC Music USA, who had purchased it from Jimmy Creticos. Springsteen subsequently registered it as "Southern SUN" in 1999, after winning a lawsuit in British court against JEC. Springsteen had clearly written "sun" on a handwritten setlist from the period, and the lyrics of "It's A Southern Sun That Shines Down On This Yankee Boy" clearly indicate it should be "Sun". Became well known by US 10-inch Acetate titled "Southern Son", with "Associated Recording Studios" on the label, typewritten song title and a handwritten "Sioux City Music Ltd." remark.

SPARE PARTS - v1a	3:36	uncirculating

Note: Recorded January 20, 1987 at Thrill Hill Recording, the first day of sessions at the Carousel House on his Rumson, New Jersey property. The second take was chosen for the album, after Garry Tallent (bass), Danny Federici (organ), and Max Weinberg (percussion) recorded their parts in April, and Toby Scott dubbed them to his base track. In June, Bruce was at Kren Studio in Hollywood, jamming with three Country sidemen. One of them was James “Jimmie” Wood, who must have played a mean harmonica, because Bruce liked it so much, he taught Jimmie "Spare Parts", and had him dubbed onto the tape. Released as a single in Europe on October 18, 1988.

SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT - V1 		uncirculating
SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT - V2 	4:57 	GREETINGS / 1973 Single / ESSENTIAL: 2003

Note: Written August 20, 1972 (give or take a few days) in response to Clive Davis’s request for some radio material, "Spirit In The Night" was issued as a single, backed with "For You", hard on the heels of "Blinded By The Light’, on May 11, 1973, produced by Bruce Springsteen, Mike Appel, and Jim Cretecos. Springsteen tried using the music for "The Fever", but quickly thought otherwise, and composed a fresh melody, starring Wild Billy, Hazy Davy, Crazy Janey, Killer Joe, G-Man and himself? V1 was recorded on September 11, 1972 at 910 Sound Studios, Blauvelt, New York. The Greetings take, with only Springsteen, Clemons and Lopez, had Bruce playing multiple instruments. Session man Harold Wheeler provided additional piano. Final dubs and mixing were completed on October 26, 1972. A stereo fold down mono version is available as the b-side of the white label promo 45. It was first played live at Max’s Kansas City, New York, NY on January 31, 1973, after which it became a staple in the show.

Note: V1 recorded on June 21, 1979 is longer, containing three additional verses and is the most interesting of all these. All recorded during June 1979. V2 is the Stanton Lake version; V4 recorded on June 20 and 21, 1979 according to the studio logs, in contrast with July 26 quoted in the Tracks liner notes. Despite the song being completed at this point Bruce, seemingly unsatisfied, decided months later to radically alter the musical arrangement. The release of The River: Single Album was the first time the two arrangements were differentiated, with the original arrangement given the title "Stolen Car (Vs.1)". V4a and V4b have slightly different mixes. V5 Springsteen sings over a tape of a band rehearsal recorded in January 1980, and V6 recorded around same time. V7 thru V14 were recorded on January 16, 1980 at Telegraph Hill, and feature revised arrangements from that of the version recorded and completed six months earlier. V6 is an oddity - it features Bruce experimenting and singing the song over a pre-recorded tape of the band's January 10 Telegraph Hill rehearsal of "Restless Nights". The end result of all this was V15, which was recorded at The Power Station on January 21 and February 20, with further mixing or overdubs undertaken on April 1 and 9, plus May 9, 1980.

Note: According to Jimmy Iovine and Jon Landau, "Streets of Fire" was nailed early in the sessions in a live performance on June 24, 1977, with only minor overdubs added later. Minor parts were recorded at either Atlantic or The Record Plant on August 24 and 30. It was sequenced as track two on side one for the aborted "Badlands" release in October. There are no alternate versions, but the guitar solo and the vocals for the final verse and outro were overdubbed on December 6, 12 and 29, 1977 at The Record Plant, with work completed in 28 takes. Mixing was completed on April 5, 1978 by Chuck Plotkin. Of the ten final tracks, only "Something In the Night" (June 1), Racing In the Street" (August 30) and "Prove It All Night" (September 16) were completed before "Streets of Fire". "The Promised Land" gave up it's spot, when Bruce had Steve Van Zandt add his guitar solo in May 1978. Mixes without the December overdubs make up version 1. Note that v1b from 'Lost Masters Vol. III' and 'The Unbroken Promise' were both clocked at 3:36, because both faded in 14 seconds into the track, while v1c, 'Original Darkness Mixes' and it's clone, 'Heart of Darkness' both had a 7 second double count-in deducted, while 'Luther' only had 1 second of it included.

STREETS OF PHILADELPHIA - V1g	3:43	TOTP video mix
STREETS OF PHILADELPHIA - V2		uncirculating
Note: Written in mid-1993 and first registered at the US Copyright office on August 27. 1993. First issued on December 30, 1993 as part of the Philadelphia soundtrack CD, then issued as a single in February 1994. However, this is a song with a complex recording and release history. All recordings were co-produced by Springsteen and Chuck Plotkin. V1a was recorded during August 1993 at Thrill Hill Recording, Beverly Hills, California, and features only Springsteen – on vocals, guitar, bass, synthesizer and drum machine. V1b appeared on the album soundtrack, V1c the single, both the same as V1a, except for the added background vocals by Tommy Sims. V1d is a significantly edited version of V1b that was released on the Greatest Hits album. V1e is the version used for the commercially released video – it is the same base recording as V1b except that it features an alternate (“live”) Springsteen vocal. V1f was released as a promotion-only single in the UK and Austria and this is allegedly yet another slightly different mix of V1b. V1g is the audio released as part of a black & white video shot in early 1994 at CBS TV Soundstage studios in New York and originally broadcast on the UK TV show ‘Top Of The Pops’. It is alleged this is yet another slight, but unique, mix variation. V2 is a different recording of the song made in October 1993, apparently at A&M Studios in Los Angeles. It features Bruce on lead vocal, instrumentation provided by Springsteen and jazz virtuoso Ornette Coleman, bass and background vocals by Tommy Sims and additional background vocals by Little Jimmy Scott. V2 was allegedly scheduled to be the officially released version up to early December 1993, when it was nixed at the last second, even after the song’s video (which featured Little Jimmy extensively) was shot. The video had to be re-shot. A brief snippet of V2 (including the tell-tale vocals of Little Jimmy Scott) is actually heard about halfway through the movie (but it’s V1b that is heard in the opening sequence of the movie).

TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT - V3a	3:08	BORN TO RUN / ESSENTIAL: 2015
TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT - V3b	3:18	private
Note: On May 5, 1975, Springsteen brought in a new song, "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out", to work with him. V1 is a brief snippet of the tail section of what appears to be a different performance. V2 is an early, complete take that was originally broadcast on E Street Radio in late 2005; this take has some considerable lyrical differences to the released version and has Springsteen phrasing the horn parts during the opening. A stereo fold down mono version is also available as the b-side of the white label promo 45. v3a was recorded on July 13, 1975 at the Record Plant, but not without difficulty. The Brecker Brothers, top session horn players, had been hired to play on Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out, but the charts Springsteen and Roy Bittan had prepared, and Bruce's instructions, were not producing the sound needed. Landau and Bruce told Steve Van Zandt, who was with them in the control room, to take charge and instruct the horn players. They both knew he was playing guitar and managing Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes, who had the sound they were looking for. Miami Steve "sang each horn player his part, with the lines, the timing and the inflection all perfect. The sessionmen obediently played their parts, and the horns were recorded. When they’d finished, Springsteen turned to Mike Appel, “Okay”, he said. “It’s time to put the boy on the payroll. I’ve been meaning to tell you—he’s the new guitar player.” - Two Hearts by Dave Marsh. Steve officially joined the E Street Band a week later on July 20, the opening night of the Born To Run tour. On July 13, 1975 Randy Brecker, of The Brecker Brothers, the jazz trumpeter hired to play on the song, told Christopher Sandford how he came in to remedy matters as the sessions for the tune started to break down. "We were the New York pros", the horn player explained, "and this wild-looking gypsy guy tears up the charts and sings the lick. From then on, things took off." v3b has cold ending (no fadeout), no guitar, keyboards, sax, but it does have a horn track; in other words, on this track there is only bass, drums, horns and vocal. different vocal track, with Bruce saying "I'm all alone, I'm all alone, I'm all alone, And, kid you better get the picture, I'm On My own and "You can't go home", singing Clarence's part too.

This ode to Jesse James and Billy The Kid was played live often and there are multiple live performances from the second half of 1971 in circulation. The studio rehearsal take from Challenger Eastern Surfboards, Highlands, NJ on March 14, 1972, is in far better quality than any of the available live versions, and was officially released in September 2016 on Chapter And Verse, the companion album to Springsteen's autobiography Born To Run. This release has been edited, reducing the length by removing some of the verses in the middle of the song.

THE E STREET SHUFFLE - V1		uncirculating
THE E STREET SHUFFLE - V2	4:24	WIESS / 1975 b-side
Note: Written around early/mid-1973, and first played live June 6, 1973, before David Sancious joined the band. V1 was recorded at 914 Sound Studios on June 28, 1973, completed on September 22. Albee Tellone, the sound manager on Bruce’s road crew from November 1972-December 1973, believes it was Sancious' presence that inspired the tune. Albee says: "I went to David's house with Bruce to learn it while David played his piano. I thought that they had written it together". He goes on to say: "We all went to the studio and played 'live' together in the large room just like we had rehearsed it in the garage in Deal, NJ. Bruce sang it 'live' then too. I was told that they were going to keep only the drums and bass parts and build overdubs from there. Bruce played rhythm on his Telecaster but replaced it later as the tracks were added. I came back on another day to overdub my sax part. We also recorded the 'tune-up' intro with tuba and cornet separately when I came back to play the baritone sax part". Albee Tellone guests on baritone sax, and would be a special guest on this song during the first three months of the October-December 1973 tour.
Thanks to Albee for the information.

THE FEVER	7:41	18TRACKS / SA914 / FS
Note: Written in late 1971, as evidenced by a dated lyric sheet titled "(I Got The) Fever For The Girl", on display at the Hard Rock Cafe, Sydney, Australia. It is believed the earliest known live performance was during a March 1973 residency at Oliver’s in Boston, though rumors of 1972 performances exist. It was played live several more times into May. The studio version was recorded (in one take) on May 16, 1973 at 914 Sound Studios, though rumors have persisted for years that it dates from WGOE Studios, Richmond, VA on May 31. The recording features the Springsteen-Federici-Tallent-Clemons-Lopez lineup (pre-Sancious) and doesn’t include any overdubs. Mike Appel requested the studio take for publishing purposes, and Laurel Canyon Publishing company registered it as "Fever For The Girl". It does not appear that Springsteen had the song seriously in mind for his next album. In late 1973, Appel sent the demo to UK Publisher Intersong Music, and in early 1974, he sent cassettes to several USA radio stations. The song was an underground hit in places like Houston, Phoenix and Boston. In Philadelphia, according to a listener, “the song exploded!” With vigorous backing by influential Philly DJ and Bruce fan, Ed Sciaky, the song was played on WMMR as part of their regular rotation. Phone-in requests would have had the song played at least 4 times daily.

"The Fever" became a legendary 70s progressive FM-radio hit, but nowhere as big as in Houston, Texas, thanks to the March 1974 Liberty Hall shows, and several radio broadcasts. After a successful interview by KLOL-FM's Ed Beauchamp on March 8, Springsteen was invited back the next day with the E Street Band, for a lengthy afternoon radio performance that included highlights from both his albums, plus a rendition of "The Fever". That night at Liberty Hall, a fan yelled "The Fever" and Bruce responded with "it's a weird thing 'The Fever'… that song 'Fever' we did as a demo tape about a year ago… and Mike here… sent it down to just this radio station, you know…. and it's a song we never even did but uh like we did it on the radio today, but I promise if we'll come back, we'll work it up for you." At the late show the next day, Springsteen introduced the song by saying: "We're gonna try something now, this is a song we haven't done in about a year but we found out that they sent a demo down here … we're gonna give it a try for you, hope we'll remember … it's a song we did about a year ago, no, we did it when we were recording the second album … they sent the tape down here and I guess KLOF has been playing it you know… who?… is that wrong? Sorry, folks but whoever, the radio station." David Sancious later said he had been under the impression it was an old Sam Cooke classic.

After they left Texas, "The Fever" was not played again until they returned on July 14, 1978 to San Antonio. Springsteen has said he never liked "The Fever", but played it on the Darkness tour in many cities because, "people would jump onstage and grab me by the head and scream, ‘Bruce! Fever!" It was played at Sam Houston Coliseum in Houston the next evening, and twenty-two more times to the end of the Darkness tour, including twelve just in December. Though he joined Southside Johnny for duets many times, and it was rehearsed during soundchecks for the 1999-2000 Reunion tour, it was not performed again until September 24, 1999 in Philadelphia, PA. First released by UK singer Allan Rich as "Fever For The Girl" in 1975 but failed to make much impact. In June 1976, it was included on Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes' debut album, I Don't Want to Go Home, under the title "The Fever", and became a Jukes classic. In early 1977, a bootleg 7" demo (the studio take from 1973) of "The Fever" was released, coupled with "Rendezvous", recorded live on November 4, 1976, at the Palladium, New York, which opens with Bruce calling out "New York! Go ahead, Max!". In 1979, The Pointer Sisters recorded the song under the title "(She Got) The Fever", for their album Priority. Finally, after being left off Tracks, along with "The Promise" in 1998, to great dismay, it was officially released in April 1999 on 18 Tracks. The song was part of the movie soundtrack to the 2007 film Lucky You.

Note: First debuted live on August 3, 1976 at the Monmouth Performing Arts Center in Red Bank, New Jersey, featuring Bruce solo on the piano, and deeply personal lyrics. Later live versions would continue to feature Bruce on piano, with Roy or Danny accompanying him on glockenspiel. The song was played live during the 1976-1977 Lawsuit Tour, and the first studio demo was recorded at Atlantic Studios on June 1, 1977. V1 was one of the takes recorded during the sessions on June 30, July 1, 7, 8 and 13, 1977. After a break that included a trip with Steve to Utah and Nevada, Bruce came back to the studio with slightly revised lyrics, and recorded V2 on August 24, and then added dubs and mixing on August 30, 1977, which was the last day of operations at Atlantic Studios. V3 was recorded on September 28, 1977 at the Record Plant, and is considered the definitive version by collectors and long-time fans. It's done with the full E Street Band, and was first released unofficially on 'Deep Down In the Vaults'. However, Bruce found it lacking, and in late September-early October, after a Rolling Stone reporter suggested the song was actually about the lawsuit with Mike Appel, Springsteen re-wrote the first two lines of verse 3, with "Well, my daddy taught me how to walk quiet and how to make my peace with the past, I learned real good to tighten up inside and I don’t say nothing unless I’m asked" replacing "I won big once and I hit the coast, oh but somehow I paid the big cost". Landau agreed solidifying the narrative, and that "The Promise" deserved to be on the January 16 sequence for the then-untitled Album #4 ("Badlands" or "American Madness" were the two front-runners). The new sequence had "Badlands" as the opener, and "The Promise" as the album closer. According to Clinton Heylin, at no point did it seem that Springsteen ever considered calling the album The Promise.

On January 12, 1978, V4 was shot live in-the-studio by Barry Rebo, and one of the takes was released on the Thrill-Hill Blu-Ray/DVD2 in the 2010 box set, The Promise:The Darkness On the Edge Of Town Story. Springsteen worked on mixing and dubbing after this, and added strings (according to Landau, a 'string' version was cut as V5). Finally, on January 24, 1978, without the E Street Band, Springsteen sat down at the piano and recorded V6 by himself, just as he did when locked out of the recording studio when the song was first played live. A Ruffs tape (see image above) provided to Springsteen by his engineer, Jimmy Iovine and mixed on February 17, included the September 28, 1977 recording featuring the "old verse" (V3), followed by the January 12 session with the "new verse" (V4) and the strings and "full harmony" version (V5) which was cut in mid-January. There is no doubt that Springsteen cared deeply about "The Promise", as a total of ten sessions were held from January 17 to March 7 (a seven week period). Saying he still "felt too close to it", at a certain point in March 1978, it was decided that a different song would be considered for its slot on Album #4 and "The Promise" was removed from the April track sequence for the album. In 2010, Springsteen noted that "It was a song about defeat, and it was self-referential, which made me uncomfortable. I didn't want it to overtake the album, which in the end, was not my personal story. I wanted 'Darkness' to be completely independent of that. So I left it off. But I remember saying to myself, 'This is something I can sing later'. The distance helps it now."

During a Darkness Tour rehearsal in Asbury Park on May 19, 1978, a full band version (including the "Daddy taught me how to walk quiet" lyric) was rehearsed, and full band version was performed on the tour's opening night in Buffalo. The next night, Bruce reverted to the solo piano version, which was played at 22 of the first 33 shows on the tour, and dropped after the July 15, 1978 show in Houston, Texas.

When Tracks was released in 1998, both "The Fever" and "The Promise" were absent from the 66-song tracklist. Both were later included on 18 Tracks, in part due to fan demand. Instead of releasing the existing V3 or V5 versions, Springsteen re-recorded "The Promise" from scratch (V9) on February 9 and 12, 1999 at Boxwood Studios, Rumson, New Jersey, in a solo piano version that many felt paled in comparison to the 1976-78 versions. In an interview with Charlie Rose, Springsteen stated, "Basically, I went back and I listened to it and we never really got a good recording of it in my opinion. It’s been a favorite song of a lot of people … It sort of was the sequel to "Thunder Road" in some fashion, it referred back to those characters. But I went back and we sort of had a very plodding, heavy-handed version of it. I couldn't quite live with it, so maybe another time."

V3 was used as the base track for V10, on The Promise outtake album in 2010, with overdubbed strings, guitars, glockenspiel, and double tracked vocals. Two lines of verse three were deleted ("I followed that dream through the southwestern tracks, the dead ends and the two-bit bars / When the promise was broken I was far away from home, sleeping in the backseat of a borrowed car"), reducing the total running time. A modern string arrangement by Ken Ascher was also added. The full-band version was performed by the E Street Band at a promotional video shoot in 2010, and again on April 1, 2012 in Washington, DC. In a curious parallel to 1978, after performing the full-band version exactly once on the 2012 tour, Springsteen has reverted to solo-piano versions for all performances since.

Note: One of the last songs written and recorded for the album, it's genesis was from a short trip taken by Bruce, Steve Van Zandt and photographer Eric Meola on August 17, 1977, two days after breaking from recording for a week. Their plan was to fly into Salt Lake City, Utah, rent a vintage American car, and drive to Reno, Nevada, by way of the Utah and Nevada wilderness. The fruits of their journey were "Rattlesnake speedway in the Utah desert", "the dogs on Main Street howl because they understand" (based on real dogs howling on a Main Street), and Eric's photographs, which appeared throughout The Promise: The Darkness On The Edge Of Town Story box set. Upon returning, Bruce composed "The Promised Land", and introduced it to the band on September 30, 1977, with 3 takes attempted V1 backing track. Recording resumed on October 27 at the Record Plant, with 20 takes, including V2 and V3 take 19, marked "long ending". V4 take 5 was recorded on December 1 or 27, 1977, and pressed to metal acetate on April 12, 1978. V4a was the final version without the guitar solo. On or about May 10, 1978, Bruce decided a guitar intro was needed before Clarence Clemons's powerful sax solo. After Steve Van Zandt recorded it in New York, Side 2 was mastered for a second time, at The Mastering Lab, Los Angeles, which briefly delayed the album release to June 2.

Note: First known from a soundcheck performance on September 20, 1978 at the Capitol Theatre in Passaic. While it shares some lyrics with the finished article, it otherwise bears little resemblance. This first incarnation of "The Ties That Bind" is a blues driven hard rock song with some searing lead guitar work. Another soundcheck performance of this arrangement circulates, a partial recording said to have been taped from outside the Capitol Theatre the following day, although this is in some doubt. A faster, more confident performance. This original arrangement was extensively revised by October 26, 1978, when V1-V3 were recorded at Telegraph Hill in a rehearsal before the final leg of the Darkness tour. Although still a work-in-progress, it is much closer to the final arrangement. It was premiered live six days later at Princeton University and played regularly for the remainder of the tour, eventually taking a prominent spot as the opening song of the second set.

The band picked it back up in late March 1979 once again at Telegraph Hill with V4 and V5, still needing work on the second and third verses. V5 is more advanced, and both still retain the drum introduction from the Darkness tour arrangement that was dropped for the final take. In April, sessions commenced at Power Station studios for album #5, with engineer Bob Clearmountain. After finishing "Roulette", work began on finishing "The Ties That Bind", with takes recorded on April 9, 10 and 11. Version 6 is take 8, chosen as the title track for the album to be released later in the year. V6a was one early mix with different vocals. V6b was mixed by Clearmountain in September 1979, but after the album came back from mastering in October, Bruce called a halt to the release, and resumed writing songs and recording. Jon Landau helped to sell him on the double album idea, and The River was released in 1980. The first track on side one was V6c, with possible overdubs and mixing on April 10, 1980, and final mixing by Chuck Plotkin and Toby Scott at Clover Studios in May-June.

Note: Written in mid-1972. This was performed live regularly, usually as the big show closer, from October 1972 right up until Vini Lopez’ departure from the band in February 1974. "It ended three or four different times -you didn't know where it was going to go. It was just a big, epic show-ender that was meant to leave the audience gasping a little bit for their breath - "Hey, who was that guy? That was pretty good…", Bruce said at a 1999 interview for Mojo magazine. The base track V1 recorded on June 22, 1973, with additional takes or overdubs on August 7 and 9, were not completed to Springsteen's satisfaction. V4 for Tracks added overdubs, including background vocals by Vini Lopez cut in 1997, to approximate the sound of live performances. "I found a version which was actually pretty good, called up Vini Lopez and I said, "Vini, I have some singing for you to do" and Vini - he's a caddy master at a golf course - he just comes by and I said, "Remember this song?" He came in and sang all his parts completely unprompted, like he remembered it exactly from 25 years ago", he added at the Mojo interview.

Note: Started out as a 1972 song called "Angelina", then after further development, Bruce did V1, a solo recording in October 1974 at 914 Sound Studios, Blauvelt NY of "Chrissie’s Song", including the line "Leave what you’ve lost, leave what’s grown cold, Thunder Road". Sometime between November 1974 and January 1975, Bruce took 'Chrissie' and the following lyrics from "Walking In the Street", and combined them into a composition he now called "Wings For Wheels" V2, recorded in February. The line, "they case the promised land" and verse, "Oh baby I can't lay the stars at your feet, but I think we could take it all, just you and me, Oh come on and see there's a lot of room, For you baby in this front seat". On February 5, 1975 at the Main Point, Bryn Mawr, PA, with Angelina his new girl in the song, Ed Sciaky introduced the radio broadcast that included 'Born To Run', 'She's the One', 'Jungleland', and 'Wings For Wheels'. A memorable moment, not preserved for album #3, was Suki Lahav’s violin behind Bruce: "Now the season's over and I feel it getting cold, Well, I wish I could take you to some sandy beach, where we'd never grow old, ah, but baby, you know that's just jive, tonight's bustin' open and I'm alive, Oh, do what you can do to make me feel like a man". But "Wings" had a horrible jazz ending ("snake charmer's song with a beat"), and sometime after March 9 (the last time "Wings" appeared on a set list), Bruce took the music he had written for "Walking In the Street", and patched it on to the end of "Wings for Wheels"; now his new lyric "this is a town for losers, I'm pulling out of here to win" was followed by the new instrumentral outro. "The night's bustin' open, these two lanes will take us anywhere", and a poster for a 1958 Robert Mitchum movie in the lobby of a movie theater, provided the final ingredients for "Thunder Road".

The exact mechanics behind moving "Walking In the Street" to "Wings For Wheels" is not known, but besides being mostly ignored, there seems to be no end of alternate explanations for the magic that suddenly came to "Thunder Road". While the contributions of people like Landau, Roy Bittan, and Max Weinberg cannot be overlooked, nothing came close to the new instrumental ending. According to the 2005 documentary, "Wings For Wheels the Making of Born to Run", Landau says he helped restructure some songs. Meanwhile, the film shows the band performing the old Wings for Wheels outro on February 6, 1975 at Widener College, Chester, Pennsylvania; then it cuts to the now familiar instrumental ending of "Thunder Road", implying Landau was the person who made the change, or you be the judge. Bruce has never breathed a word about this, which worked out quite well, except he claims to have lost the completed tape of "Walking In the Street", recorded May 28, 1975, which is also why it could not go on "Tracks". Another point of view is that most of "Walking In the Street" was incorporated into "Thunder Road", which brings up the question, what was recorded in two takes on May 28 at the Record Plant?

April 13, 1975 was the day Jon Landau officially joined the album #3 production team. Louis Lahav, chief engineer, and his wife Suki, the violin player, quit and returned to their native Israel at the end of February (this is often misreported as months later, which is incorrect, and the story that she and Bruce were in love, and that the Lahavs left to save their marriage, has nothing to do with "Thunder Road"). Jimmy Iovine reported to work at the Record Plant on April 18, after Landau was instructed to find better accommodations. Thunder Road and Jungleland were the first two songs recorded that day, and a total of three versions of "Thunder Road" would be recorded over April 18-19 and 23, 1975. V3a is a full-band version, the girl is now Chrissie, and ends with the build up, instrumental outro, 2 refrains led by Clarence, to a quick, full ending (no fadeout). V3b has 2 extra refrains for an extra long ending. The lyrics are getting there, but the guitar is not yet talking, and "Leave what you’ve lost, leave what’s grown cold, Thunder Road" from "Chrissie's Song" is still there. V4 is a haunting acoustic solo version, one of Bruce’s greatest studio performances; the girl is now Christina, but otherwise no lyrical changes. V5, released on E Street Radio, is from April 23, starts with Roy Bittan's piano, base rhythm and Bruce's vocal and guitar (no organ or sax). "Leave what you’ve lost, leave what’s grown cold" now replaced with "Sit tight, take hold", a major change. The final refrain is led by piano, with Bruce's overdubbed guitar. V6, recorded, or at least overdubbed, on July 15 or 16, and we are almost ready to open "Born To Run". This take opens with saxophone and Roy's piano, which dominates the first 2 minutes with Bruce's now awesome vocal, introduces us to Mary, and rocks all the way through, dominated by guitar. The long outro mixes guitar, sax and piano just like the album, and has 7 refrains, though one variation only has 5. V7 now has piano and harmonica opening without sax, glock, the talking guitar and Mary, and after 12 hours mixing and dubbing guitars, was completed on July 16, 1975, with Mike Appel on background vocals.

Note: Written Spring 1972. V1 was early demo at Pocketful of Tunes, 39 West 55th Street, New York, NY, April-May 1972. V2 recorded February 19, 1973 at 914 Sound Studios, Blauvelt, New York with Bruce on piano. V3 logged following day. It is possible the circulating audio is V1 or V3. No record of V4 cut in studio, which featured addition of new lyrics and a refrain, "And The Band Played", and performed live occasionally by Bruce during 1973 and early 1974. At some point in 1974 Springsteen composed a list of ten songs that were candidates for inclusion on his third album. A song with the title "Shanghai" is the ninth song on that list, and based on the lyrics we assume that it is actually "Tokyo". Though this was played live sporadically during the next year, studio takes of "Tokyo (And The Band Played)" have not been located. Springsteen copyrighted it as "Tokyo" in 1999, after winning his lawsuit against bootleggers.

TUNNEL OF LOVE 	5:06 	TUNNEL / ESSENTIAL: 2003 / 1987 single

Note: In late June or early July, Springsteen called Toby Scott to the Carriage House to record the final song for the still unnamed album, "Tunnel Of Love". Bruce played all instruments, including drums, even though the complex pattern for the drum box was programmed by Scott. Next, Toby was sent to get "carnival sounds", which were recorded at Point Pleasant Amusement Park, New Jersey. The first take failed to get the proper screams and sounds, so when he returned a few days later, he enlisted the help of the owner, and successfully recorded a train full of young teenagers on the "mouse" roller coaster. After choreographing the screaming, he brought the tape back, which filled the spots where Bruce wanted the amusement sounds. Overdubs were added by Nils Lofgren (lead guitar), Roy Bittan (synthesizers), Max Weinberg (percussion) and Patti Scialfa (vocals). Finally, "Lucky Man" was removed from the unnamed album's sequence to make room for the title cut of the coming fall release, Tunnel Of Love, and became the b-side of the first single, "Brilliant Disguise".

WALK LIKE A MAN	3:33	TUNNEL
Note: Recorded January 20, 1987 at Thrill Hill East (Springsteen’s NJ home studio) on the very first day of the sessions. The first take. Springsteen handles multiple instruments and his one-man backing band on this recording is Max Weinberg (drums). Bruce has grown in the 10 years since he wrote "Adam Raised A Cain". He really let his anger towards his father go, but now he looks back with more clarity. His father Doug worked in a factory with such high noise levels, that he was legally deaf when he was done. "Well now the years have gone and I've grown from that seed you've sown, but I didn't think there'd been so many steps I'd have to learn on my own, Well I was young and I didn't know what to do when I saw your best steps stolen away from you, Now I'll do what I can, I'll walk like a man, And I'll keep on walking……."

WALKING IN THE STREET - V3		uncirculating
flickr:48716576412
Note: "Lovers In The Cold", interchangeable with it's other title, "Walking In the Street" (Walking) was first worked on V1 around August 10, 1974, and then a rough, clearly unfinished V2 was recorded on October 16-17, 1974 at 914 Sound Studios. In January 1975, Bruce decided to move the following lyrics to another composition called "Wings For Wheels"; the line, "they case the promised land" and the verse, "Oh baby I can't lay the stars at your feet, but I think we could take it all, just you and me, Oh come on and see there's a lot of room, For you baby in this front seat". Then in March, he took the main coda of Walking, and used it as the instrumental outro of "Wings for Wheels", which became "Thunder Road". It seemed that there was nothing left, but Walking refused to die. It first appeared on one of the earliest Springsteen studio bootlegs, "E Ticket" by Ruthless Rhymes Records, described as "a totally unreleased song from the Born to Run sessions". This was the first of an almost endless stream of bootlegs it appeared on as both "Walking In the Street(s)" and "Lovers In the Cold", such as "Born In the Studio", "War And Roses - The Definitive Born To Run Outtakes Collection", and "Running Out Of Innocence" by Godfatherecords.

The Wings For Wheels documentary (at about 40:55) shows a Record Plant reel with a label that indicates that at least two complete takes of Walking were recorded on May 28, 1975 V3 (see illustration). This could well be the missing reel, but we can't be certain. Springsteen later taped a rehearsal at Monmouth Post Theater in January 1999, perhaps with a view to issuing a fresh recording of Walking on 18 Tracks alongside "The Promise". Springsteen commented to Mark Hagen of Mojo magazine in 1999, "There was another one called 'Walking In The Street' which I would have liked to have put on, but I couldn't find the master. We searched and searched. It might have been simply recorded over, because in those days, if something wasn't going to make it, you're going to need that tape so you recorded something else over the top."

If you want to hear Walking, turn on "Thunder Road". The instrumental outro was the coda of Walking, and he is still "casing the promised land" with his greatest song, depending on which poll you read. Bruce has no desire to hear or play part of Thunder Road in another song that was obsolete in 1975, with only a few lines like, "Standing on the corner with a gun underneath his coat" remaining. He did not authorize Walking to appear in 100 bootlegs, and has not made one thin dime from it. The May 28 two takes at the Record Plant story, on the day he spent doing at least 20 takes of his new song, "The Heist", was a mistake, as were the other comments. Here is another Bruce quote about another song he does NOT want to play, but he played it on the Darkness tour in many cities because, “people would jump onstage and grab me by the head and scream, ‘Bruce! Fever!’" Bruce still wakes up in a cold sweat, after a fan in his dream grabs him by the head and screams, "Bruce! Walking In the Street! Lovers In the Cold!!" Just kidding Bruce, relax; being the greatest sure ended up involving a lot of pressure and trauma to your brain and spirit, but you still played "The Fever" 24 times on the Darkness tour, because despite it all, you are still the same nice guy you have always been. So don't worry about Walking, it lives on in "Thunder Road", a song you do like playing. "Tonight we're lovers on that road, running past the graveyards in the snow, and now we all know Walking in the Street never had anywhere to go, oh oh oh…"

WILD BILLY'S CIRCUS STORY - V4		uncirculating

Note: Written in 1972 as "Circus Town", and performed live as an acoustic show opener, from December 1972 (by which time it was being called "Circus Song"), up until mid-1974. Inspired by memories of the circus that came to Freehold every summer when Bruce was young, he brilliantly describes the cast of characters as the tuba plays, "I’ve stood around carnivals at midnight when they’re clearing up and I was scared, I met some dangerous people.” Some of the descriptions are wierd or gross, but he finally loses it in last verse, when the midget or Tiny Tim get lifted above the "liars". On April 24, 1973 at the Main Point, Little Tiny Tim says, "Sampson, where's the liars? Oh, they're outside cryin' Oh, hear the liars Oh, feel their fire Hear the liars, They're so scared of dyin", after which he sings "Well, anybody wanna try the big top? All aboard, Nebraska's our next stop." Though he had performed "Circus Song" with these lyrics since January, he made a change just before appearing May 1, 1973, at the Ahmanson Theater in Los Angeles, where it was to be filmed for showing at the CBS Sales Convention in July. The final verse was changed to, "And the strong man, Sampson, lifts the midget, little Tiny Tim, way up on his shoulders, way up and carries him on down the midway, past the kids, past the sailors, to his dimly lit trailer, And the Ferris go 'round and 'round like it ain't ever gonna stop, And the circus boss is whispering into some little boy's ear, "Hey son, you wanna try the big top?" All aboard, Nebraska's our next stop!". In the blink of an eye, "Circus Song" went from the killer of every boy's dream to run away and join the circus, to something less nefarious, and that's the way it stayed. The first WIESS studio recordings V1 and V2 were made on May 14, 1973 at 914 Sound Studios, with 8 takes; it is not known if any of these recordings survived. An almost perfect recording of "Circus Song" was recorded on May 31, 1973 at WGOE Radio Alpha Studios, Richmond, Virginia. It's available on Über Series Vol 22. Work on 'Circus Song' was resumed on June 25, 26 and final dubs on the 28th, the complete album take renamed, "Wild Billy's Circus Story". When or why the title of the song was changed is not currently known, but it was June or later. This song might not exist without amazing bass player Garry Tallent on tuba and organist Danny Federici on accordian, "Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven" says the crowd with or without the ringmaster.

THUNDER ROAD - V7	4:45	BORN TO RUN / ESSENTIAL / GREATEST
Note: Started out as a 1972 song called "Angelina", then after further development, Bruce did V1, a solo recording in October 1974 at 914 Sound Studios, Blauvelt NY of "Chrissie’s Song", including the line "Leave what you’ve lost, leave what’s grown cold, Thunder Road". Sometime between November 1974 and January 1975, Bruce took 'Chrissie' and the following lyrics from "Walking In the Street", and combined them into a composition he now called "Wings For Wheels" V2, recorded in February. The line, "they case the promised land" and verse, "Oh baby I can't lay the stars at your feet, but I think we could take it all, just you and me, Oh come on and see there's a lot of room, For you baby in this front seat". On February 5, 1975 at the Main Point, Bryn Mawr, PA, with Angelina his new girl in the song, Ed Sciaky introduced the radio broadcast that included 'Born To Run', 'She's the One', 'Jungleland', and 'Wings For Wheels'. A memorable moment, not preserved for album #3, was Suki Lahav’s violin behind Bruce: "Now the season's over and I feel it getting cold, Well, I wish I could take you to some sandy beach, where we'd never grow old, ah, but baby, you know that's just jive, tonight's bustin' open and I'm alive, Oh, do what you can do to make me feel like a man". But "Wings" had a horrible jazz ending ("snake charmer's song with a beat"), and sometime after March 9 (the last time "Wings" appeared on a set list), Bruce took the music he had written for "Walking In the Street", and patched it on to the end of "Wings for Wheels"; now his new lyric "this is a town for losers, I'm pulling out of here to win" was followed by the new instrumentral outro. "The night's bustin' open, these two lanes will take us anywhere", and a poster for a 1958 Robert Mitchum movie in the lobby of a movie theater, provided the final ingredients for "Thunder Road".

The exact mechanics behind moving "Walking In the Street" to "Wings For Wheels" is not known, but besides being mostly ignored, there seems to be no end of alternate explanations for the magic that suddenly came to "Thunder Road". While the contributions of people like Landau, Roy Bittan, and Max Weinberg cannot be overlooked, nothing came close to the new instrumental ending. According to the 2005 documentary, "Wings For Wheels the Making of Born to Run", Landau says he helped restructure some songs. Meanwhile, the film shows the band performing the old Wings for Wheels outro on February 6, 1975 at Widener College, Chester, Pennsylvania; then it cuts to the now familiar instrumental ending of "Thunder Road", implying Landau was the person who made the change, or you be the judge. Bruce has never breathed a word about this, which worked out quite well, except he claims to have lost the completed tape of "Walking In the Street", recorded May 28, 1975, which is also why it could not go on "Tracks". Another point of view is that most of "Walking In the Street" was incorporated into "Thunder Road", which brings up the question, what was recorded in two takes on May 28 at the Record Plant?

April 13, 1975 was the day Jon Landau officially joined the album #3 production team. Louis Lahav, chief engineer, and his wife Suki, the violin player, quit and returned to their native Israel at the end of February (this is often misreported as months later, which is incorrect, and the story that she and Bruce were in love, and that the Lahavs left to save their marriage, has nothing to do with "Thunder Road"). Jimmy Iovine reported to work at the Record Plant on April 18, after Landau was instructed to find better accommodations. Thunder Road and Jungleland were the first two songs recorded that day, and a total of three versions of "Thunder Road" would be recorded over April 18-19 and 23, 1975. V3a is a full-band version, the girl is now Chrissie, and ends with the build up, instrumental outro, 2 refrains led by Clarence, to a quick, full ending (no fadeout). V3b has 2 extra refrains for an extra long ending. The lyrics are getting there, but the guitar is not yet talking, and "Leave what you’ve lost, leave what’s grown cold, Thunder Road" from "Chrissie's Song" is still there. V4 is a haunting acoustic solo version, one of Bruce’s greatest studio performances; the girl is now Christina, but otherwise no lyrical changes. V5, released on E Street Radio, is from April 23, starts with Roy Bittan's piano, base rhythm and Bruce's vocal and guitar (no organ or sax). "Leave what you’ve lost, leave what’s grown cold" now replaced with "Sit tight, take hold", a major change. The final refrain is led by piano, with Bruce's overdubbed guitar. V6, recorded, or at least overdubbed, on July 15 or 16, and we are almost ready to open "Born To Run". This take opens with saxophone and Roy's piano, which dominates the first 2 minutes with Bruce's now awesome vocal, introduces us to Mary, and rocks all the way through, dominated by guitar. The long outro mixes guitar, sax and piano just like the album, and has 7 refrains, though one variation only has 5. V7 now has piano and harmonica opening without sax, glock, the talking guitar and Mary, and after 12 hours mixing and dubbing guitars, was completed on July 16, 1975, with Mike Appel on background vocals.

**** On the tracks

YOU MEAN SO MUCH TO ME - V1		uncirculating
YOU MEAN SO MUCH TO ME - V2		DDITV / ESRR / MT1 / UBER22
YOU MEAN SO MUCH TO ME - V3		uncirculating
Note: Written in early 1971 as "When She Sings To Me"; title was changed to "You Mean So Much To Me" later in the year. Bruce introduced the song as "When She Sings To Me" in July 1971. Rehearsed at Challenger East Surfboard Factory, though apparently not on the evening of March 14, 1972, because it was absent from the tapes recorded by Tinker West. It was performed throughout 1971, although the circulating live versions mostly stem from the middle months. First caught on tape July 10, 1971 by The Bruce Springsteen Band. Another song that would be ranked in the top tier of Springsteen’s pre-CBS portfolio. Bruce obviously felt this was one of his best early creations, as he continued to perform it live regularly throughout 1973 and 1974. On May 31, 1973, what many consider the definitive version was cut at the recording studio for WGOE-FM radio, Richmond’s Alpha Sound Studios. There are no records of it being recorded at 914 Sound Studios for Greetings or The Wild, The Innocent, but many undocumented sessions are known to exist during mid-1973, held between 12 midnight and dawn, to avoid having to pay the studio. It is likely most of the base tracks for The Wild were recorded in mid-June 1973 in this fashion, and would explain why most of that information is also missing. However, perhaps the biggest mystery is how the money-conscious Mike Appel, and his partner Jimmy Cretecos, could fail to record a demo for publishing purposes, unless they used the May 31 WGOE tape. Never officially released, it was first bootlegged on 'Deep Down In The Vaults' in the 1990s. In late 1975, Steve Van Zandt and Bruce Springsteen decided to get their friend John Lyon and his band Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes a contract and record an album. Bruce helped out by donating two of his compositions to the effort, "You Mean So Much To Me" and "The Fever". At the Record Plant one day, he ran into Ronnie Spector, who had been invited by Van Zandt. Inspired, he quickly wrote an arrangement for "You Mean So Much To Me" as a duet for Ronnie and Southside Johnny, which became the closing song on side 2 of the Jukes' debut album, I Don't Want To Go Home. Ronnie agreed to tour with the Jukes throughout 1976-1977, and their duet was a regular encore and show closer. On May 12-13, 1977, when Bruce filled in for Southside, out because of illness, he sang the duet with Ronnie Spector three times in two nights at the Monmouth County Arts Center.

Note: "Phantoms", also known by the titles "Over The Hills Of St. George" and "Over The Hills Of St. Croix", was written during early 1973, and apparently performed live several times during May and June, notably including the sole recorded performance on June 13 at Binghampton, NY. Sony logs during The Wild, The Innocent sessions show "Phantoms" was worked on June 22 and 26: this produced V1, the backing track of both final studio tracks of "Phantoms" and "Zero And Blind Terry" (also dubbed "Wild Zero And Blind Terry" out in bootleg world later on). V2, an alternate and unreleased instrumental take, was also recorded on one or both of these dates. Up until June 28, these takes were referred to as "Phantoms"; at that session, vocal tracks and instrumentation were added to V1 for both "Phantoms" V3, and "Zero and Blind Terry" V4, completing each. But on July 1, 1973, Bruce added additional dubs to Phantoms V3, making V5 the final take. The date of the circulating version is either June 28 or July 1. "Zero and Blind Terry" was first played live on July 18, 1973 at Max's Kansas City, New York, NY. Sony studio logs only mention "Zero" on June 28 and August 7, 1973. V1, the unreleased backing track sometimes called "Wild Zero" by bootleggers, but never called "Phantoms", except in the Official Sony logs we rely on. Along with V2, a shorter, alternate backing track that was not used, it is reasonable to assume one or both were recorded June 22 and June 26, 1973, any number of times, under the name "Phantoms" only. The first take logged of "Zero and Blind Terry" did not occur until June 28, the rock on which these statements are made. Then the studio logs list one or more takes of both of our titles on June 28, 1973, which we designate as the never heard V3 (Phantoms), and the standard version of "Zero" V4. It was pressed to acetate, used as the publishing demo, but not included on album #2. It has circulated on various boots for many years, much loved by collectors and hardcore fans. According to the Tracks session data, V6, the version on the 1998 collection, comes from the June 28 session. The logs show the June 28 version was referenced on November 5, 1997, but we could not identify the source and dates of the overdubs applied to the version on Tracks. Sancious's piano was certainly not recorded on June 28, nor were the backing vocals by Suki Lahav. The June 28 basic track was sent out as a publishing demo, in an early mix from June 28 or earlier. An overdubbed flute that had been removed by June 28 was still there. Most, and possibly all of the overdubs described here were done by and included in the August 7 session, mixed and stored away with the invisible title of V6, never circulating until being released on Tracks. Suki Lahav is also credited in the Tracks booklet. Statements referring to "Phantoms" as an early or work-in-progress version of "Zero And Blind Terry" are incorrect. These are two different songs, with no overlapping lyrics.

**** On the tracks

HYMN TO HIM	4:30	GUEST: BLUES / 2020 single
Note: The original version of "Hymn To Him" was recorded for Dion's 1987 gospel album Velvet & Steel. As songs are never finished, Dion kept hearing it with Patti's voice, and he asked her to help remake the song. Bruce joined in the studio with his guitar and played a solo.

Studio Sessions: Blues With Friends
