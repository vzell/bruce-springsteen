1949-09-23 - MONMOUTH MEDICAL CENTER, LONG BRANCH & 87 RANDOLPH STREET, FREEHOLD, NJ

Bruce Springsteen is born at the Monmouth Medical Center, Long Branch, New Jersey, on September 23. The first child of parents Adele (Zerilli) Springsteen and Douglas Springsteen. Bruce's paternal grandfather was 50% Dutch (Springsteen lineage) and 50% Irish (O'Hagen lineage). Bruce’s paternal grandmother was 100% Irish (McNicholl lineage). Both Bruce's maternal grandparents were born in Italy and were of 100% Italian lineage. So, although 'Springsteen' is a Dutch surname, Bruce’s ethnic heritage is actually a mixture of Dutch, Irish, and Italian.

This Randolph Street house (which no longer exists) was owned and occupied at the time by Bruce's paternal grandparents (Fred and Alice). Bruce's parents were merely staying there for a few years while they accumulated a deposit to buy their own place. Bruce’s sister Virginia ('Ginny') is born in 1950.

1957-01-06 - 39½ INSTITUTE STREET, FREEHOLD, NJ

Bruce parents let him stay up late to watch the last of the so-called 'trilogy' of the famous Elvis Presley TV appearances on the Ed Sullivan Show (Elvis’s first two appearances had been during 1956, this January 6, 1957 performance was the infamous 'from the waist-up only' broadcast). Bruce tells his parents he wants a guitar like Elvis’s and, within a few weeks, his mother rents a small, semi-toy acoustic (no amp) from Diehl's Music on South Street in Freehold. However, other than posing in the mirror, Bruce loses interest in trying to learn how to play, finding it too difficult and unable to fit his hand around the fret board. It will take a several more years before that interest is truly ignited. The day the guitar is returned Bruce makes his first performance in front of an audience of six or so friends in his backyard, banging on the guitar, shouting nonsense, to the amusement of those watching.

It is was sometime during the October 1962 - September 1963 period that Bruce, having saved up some money doing odd jobs, purchased a second-hand acoustic guitar (no amp) for $18 at Freehold’s Western Auto Appliance Store. Bruce’s accordion/guitar playing first cousin Frank provided some introductory lessons. Bruce has recently commented on his cousin Frank and this event: “He taught me my first chords. He was super cool. I was 13 and I went to my aunt Edie’s house where Frank played accordion in the living room. It was like Ted Mack Amateur Hour… the first song I learned was “Greensleeves”. It should be noted that first cousin Frank’s son is none other than Seeger Sessions Band guitar player (and Bruce’s second cousin) Frank Bruno.

1962-11-00 - 68 SOUTH STREET, FREEHOLD, NJ

With the birth of Bruce’s sister Pamela in January 1962 (and thus a need for another bedroom) Bruce’s parents sell the 39½ Institute Street house and rent a larger one at nearby 68 South Street from John W. Duckett. Like the previous premises, this South Street house is a two-family duplex. This will be Bruce’s home for the next seven years - until autumn 1969 when Bruce’s parents relocate to California. Bruce's mother arranges for him to rent the house from Duckett but he is asked to leave after a window is kicked out.

1963-07-00 - 68 SOUTH STREET, FREEHOLD, NJ

The surf music craze, which had been largely confined to California during the previous year, finally explodes nationally in the U.S.A. during the summer of 1963, with four huge-selling singles released (and all charting top five or better) in rapid succession: “Pipeline” (May 1963 - The Chantays), “Surfin’ U.S.A.” (June 1963 - The Beach Boys), “Surf City” (July 1963 - Jan and Dean) and “Wipe Out” (August 1963 - The Surfaris). Springsteen is heavily influenced by these four singles, particularly over the course of the next 12 months.

1963-11-00 - 68 SOUTH STREET, FREEHOLD, NJ

Arguably the first, possibly the greatest and certainly most controversial of all the U.S.A.’s mid-60s garage/frat-rock singles, “Louie Louie” by The Kingsmen, explodes nationally in the U.S. during October 1963, reaching #2 on the national charts in December 1963 (despite a radio ban in some markets due to alleged naughty lyrics). The single stays in the charts for many months and is all the chatter on high school campuses from mid-1963 to mid-1964. Springsteen, like many aspiring young musicians, is strongly influenced by the single.

1964-02-09 - 68 SOUTH STREET, FREEHOLD, NJ

Bruce, along with over 73 million other Americans, watches The Beatles’ debut live appearance on U.S.A. television on The Ed Sullivan Show. This, along with subsequent U.S.TV appearances during 1964 of other 'British Invasion' bands, has a profound, inspirational impact on Bruce. He begins to spend much of his time listening to records and practicing his acoustic guitar.

Bruce watches The Rolling Stones' debut appearance on national U.S. television show ‘Hollywood Palace’. Although they don’t know one other at this point, as fate would have it a kid a year younger than Springsteen in nearby Middletown named Steve Van Zandt is also transfixed to the television this night. Van Zandt has described watching this Stones performance as the defining moment in his decision to get a guitar and learn how to play. And this is indeed what happened - around August 1964, Van Zandt formed his first band, The Whirlwinds, which performed mainly surf-style instrumentals and which consisted of Van Zandt (guitar), Bruce Gumbert (accordion) and Neils Lybeck (drums). The group spent nearly all its brief, 5-6 month, existence practicing in the garage and did not have any paid gigs, although Bruce Gumbert has confirmed to Brucebase that they did play ‘au gratis’ once at a private party. Lybeck would eventually form 'The Chlan' in 1965, while Van Zandt formed 'The Mates' in 1965 and both Gumbert and Van Zandt would re-unite again in spring 1966 when both joined 'The Shadows'.

Bruce’s mother Adele, seeing Bruce’s focused attention on learning how to play his acoustic guitar over the past year and knowing of his strong wish to have an electric guitar, takes out a personal loan for $60 (about $600 in current terms) and buys Bruce a Japanese-made “Kent” electric guitar and amplifier package as a Christmas present (an event seemingly referred to in Bruce’s 1986 song “The Wish”). This is Bruce’s first electric guitar and he immediately immerses himself in fast-tracking his playing skills.

1965-00-00 - 68 BARKALOW AVENUE, FREEHOLD, NJ

Sometime between Christmas 1964 and Springsteen's audition for Tex Vinyard he played with a band called The Rogues. This band consisted of Jay Gibson on lead guitar, Craig Caprioni on vocals, Donnie Powell on drums and Jimmy McGuire on bass. McGuire's bass was not plugged in but he was in the band due to the fact he owned an amp. The band practiced in the basement of 68 Barkalow Avenue, Craig Caprioni's house.

TWIST AND SHOUT

After visiting and performing alone for Tex Vinyard a week earlier, Springsteen is invited for a tryout-rehearsal with the four already hired members (George Theiss, Frank Marziotti, Bart Haynes, and Danny Hyland) of 'The Castiles' present. One of the songs Bruce performed was “Twist And Shout”. Everyone is impressed and Springsteen is given the job, thus completing the formal band lineup. They will spend the next 6 weeks or so rehearsing and developing a repertoire before performing publicly. The link above provides a timeline of The Castiles' members from July 1965 to August 1968.

During late June, July and August 1965 Van Zandt’s recently formed band, The Mates, landed a residency playing every Friday night from 7pm - 11:30pm at the Clearwater Pool Lounge on Rte 36 in Middletown. Although information is very sketchy, it’s believed it was at some point during this summer residency that Springsteen came to listen to the band and first met and jammed with Van Zandt (who was a year younger and one grade behind Bruce in school).

1965-08-00 - WOODHAVEN SWIM CLUB, FREEHOLD, NJ

IN THE MOOD

No further set details known. One evening show, featuring the The Castiles in their first-ever verified public performance. Although the exact date is uncertain it is believed this took place in mid-August. The Woodhaven Swim Club was located on East Freehold Road - it later became the home of the local YMCA. According to 1970s comments by Castiles manager Tex Vinyard the group received a whopping total of $35 for the show. The show closed with a rock arrangement of The Glenn Miller Orchestra's “In The Mood”. Click the link above to view the first known photo of Springsteen on stage at the Woodhaven Swim Club. By the time of this show original member Danny Hyland (harmonica, tambourine and vocals) had been replaced by Richie Goldstein.

Springsteen mentioned this gig during an interview in Europe in 1975, commenting…“I remember starting at noon and we played until like 8 or 9 pm, when we had to stop. That was one of the first gigs I ever did”. This was further verified by George Theiss. In his 2016 autobiography Born To Run, Springsteen described this as The Castiles' first gig.

1965-10-08 - I.B. CLUB, HOWELL, NJ

No set details known. One show, double billing, with The Castiles opening for New York-based outfit The Florescents. Bruce and the band had started out by performing at obscure, private functions in Freehold. This was quite possibly Bruce and the band’s first publicly advertised nightclub appearance. Organized by shore area musician/promoter Norman Seldin, and part of a series of shows at this venue, featuring bands such as The Motifs, The Kingsmen and Johnny Thunder. Final show for Castiles member Richie Goldstein who leaves the band on this date. He is replaced by Paul Popkin. The exact reasons for Goldstein's departure from the band are unknown, but there is some doubt over his commitment. At this point the band consists of George Theiss (guitar and vocals), Bruce Springsteen (guitar and vocals), Frank Marziotti (bass), Paul Popkin (vocals and tambourine) and Bart Haynes (drums).

1965-10-00 - RECEPTION HALL, MONMOUTH COUNTY, NJ

MOONGLOW

IF YOU NEED ME / I UNDERSTAND / GOOD TIMES, BAD TIMES / SUMMERTIME / SENTIMENTAL JOURNEY / NEVER ON SUNDAY / SIDEWALK / unidentified title / IN THE MOOD / TIRED OF WAITING FOR YOU / 500 MILES / (I CAN'T GET NO) SATISFACTION / WIPE OUT / STRANGER ON THE SHORE / WHAT’D I SAY / MOON RIVER / YOU’VE LOST THAT LOVIN’ FEELING / WALK DON’T RUN / WHAT’S YOUR NAME / TILL THERE WAS YOU / THE LAST TIME / FOR YOUR LOVE / unidentified title / I GOT YOU BABE / THE 'THIRD MAN' THEME / IN THE STILL OF THE NIGHT / MONEY (THAT'S WHAT I WANT) / PLAY WITH FIRE / TELL ME

One show, with The Castiles the sole act on the bill. The above-mentioned 27 song titles (plus two titles that are illegible) have been culled from a surviving inventory/setlist document (click the link above to see the image) that was originally in the possession of a member of The Castiles. This list is believed to have emanated from a wedding reception the band performed in the autumn of 1965. With the exception of “Sidewalk” (co-written by Bruce) all of the songs are covers of other artist’s material, with the most recently released song at the time being Sonny & Cher’s “I Got You Babe” (July 1965). The setlist includes numerous 1964-1965 'British Invasion' hits by the Stones, Yardbirds, Kinks, Zombies and Beatles - a clear indication of the kind of music the band was playing at teen gigs. The high proportion of 1950s ballad material in this particular show (sung by George Theiss, not Bruce) is likely the result of it being a wedding, with manager Tex Vinyard making sure his boys also catered to the older relatives in attendance. These include the G-Clefs’ “I Understand”, Acker Bilk’s “Stranger On The Shore”, Don & Juan’s “What’s Your Name” and Anton Karas’ “The Third Man Theme”. THERE IS NO CIRCULATING AUDIO OF ANY OF THIS PERFORMANCE. Frank Marziotti has recalled the bride's choice of song was the jazz standard "Moonglow".

At some point in October 1965 the band would pose for a series of photographs taken at various sites in Freehold, including the Battle Of Monmouth Monument and Veterans Point. Click the link above to view some of these photographs.

1965-10-00 - MARLBORO STATE HOSPITAL, MARLBORO, NJ

WE GOTTA GET OUT OF THIS PLACE

No further set details known. The Castiles perform for patients at this local psychiatric hospital. Springsteen has briefly mentioned this early Castiles gig a couple of times over the years, once commenting: “This guy in a suit got up and introduced us for twenty minutes, saying we were greater than The Beatles, then the doctors came up and took him away”. George Theiss has also recalled/verified this gig to Brucebase, commenting: “there was a woman who was trying to seduce everyone and some guy was running around screaming “Banzai!”, “Banzai!”.

On 30th October 1965 drummer Bart Haynes unexpectedly quit the band. He was replaced by Vince Manniello. Haynes (who was a year older than Springsteen) graduated high school in June 1966, joined the U.S. Marines Corps in October 1966, was sent to Vietnam in April 1967 and was killed in action in October 1967.

1965-12-30 - ST JOSEPH’S SCHOOL, KEYPORT, NJ

No set details known. One show, a CYO-sponsored 'battle-of-the bands' event held in the school auditorium, with 16 groups competing for a $200 First Prize and the right to be crowned 'Best Teenage Band of 1965' in the area. A crowd of over 1,200 watched the contest and the winner was chosen by three people working in the music industry, including a representative of Brian Epstein. Each band played a couple of songs. The 1st Place winner was Red Bank-based 'The Clique', with Long Branch-based 'The Inmates' in 2nd place and Keyport-based 'The Cascades' coming in 3rd. Also on the bill were 'The Rising Suns (whose line-up included future Castiles organist Bobby Alfano).

It was long-thought that The Castiles played at this show; Emile Talarico, drummer and co-vocalist for The Clique, has jokingly commented "That’s my claim to fame. We beat Bruce Springsteen in a battle of the bands”. However, new evidence, taken from the Red Bank Register, suggests that The Castiles never took part in this Battle of the Bands. The obvious explanation for the confusion is that they have been mixed up with similarly-named The Cascades.

It was long-thought that The Castiles placed third in this contest but in actuality they did not place in the top five. The top three bands plus a selection of the other most popular acts were given an opportunity to perform at the Roller Drome the following week as part of a major concert headlined by The Dovells, The Ad-Libs and The Crystals. Springsteen, Vini Lopez and judge Vinnie Roslin (future Steel Mill bass guitarist) meet for the first time at this event. Lopez has recalled that The Castiles were the best band to play, and should have won.

In an interview on Little Steven's Underground Garage radio show, Bruce recalled that The Castiles performed Them's "Mystic Eyes" during a Battle Of The Bands event at the Matawan-Keyport Roller Drome in 1966. However, he also said that the prize for winning the Battle was to perform the following week with The Rascals, which does not tally with this event. It is possible that Bruce was mistaken, and perhaps was confusing this event with another - The Rascals did perform at the Roller Drome in early June 1966, but not as part of a Battle Of The Bands. Brucebase can find no information about another Battle at the Roller Drome in 1966 - certainly none were advertised in the Matawan Journal. In that case perhaps Bruce was mistaken about the prize, and it was this event he remembers.

1966-04-29 - MATAWAN-KEYPORT ROLLER DROME, MATAWAN, NJ

One show, a multi-artist extravaganza promoted by Norman Seldin, headlined by nationally famous artists The Crystals, The Dovells and The Ad-Libs. The show featured seven local bands on the undercard. Norman Seldin's 'Soul Set' opened for the national acts. The other local bands played for the dancers. There has long been confusion as to whether The Castiles played at this show. Evidence from three local newspapers now suggests they did not.

1966-05-00 - LE TEENDEZVOUS, NEW SHREWSBURY, NJ

No set details known. One show, in very early May, with The Castiles the sole act on the bill. Le Teendezvous, a popular club for teenagers that had opened in 1964, would end up being a frequent performing venue for The Castiles and later Springsteen bands during the 1966-69 period. This gig at Le Teendezvous was bass player Frank Marziotti’s final one as a member of the The Castiles. Although the other members didn’t want him to leave, Marziotti was about 10 years older than the others and had his own service station business to run. Marziotti has commented in interview: “After the show a kid came up to me and asked me if I was Bruce’s father. I took that as a sign that it was time for me to go”.

1966-05-18 - MR MUSIC INC STUDIO, BRICKTOWN, NJ

Live rehearsals at site - and then formal recording - of two 'Springsteen/Theiss' songs, “Baby I” and “That’s What You Get”. Bruce and George wrote both songs in Tex Vinyard’s car on the way to Mr Music, a company that no longer exists but was then located at 2785 Hooper Ave in what is part of the Brick Mall complex. George Theiss has confirmed that these were the only two songs that Bruce and he ever co-wrote.

The recordings were cut directly to disc, which resulted in a significant loss of fidelity compared to how the band actually sounded. Seven or eight acetate test pressings of the studio takes were made (at least four of which survive). It was long thought that there was no master tape, but in an interview with Jim Henke for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum Springsteen notes that they emerged from the studio with a 'two-track' which was 'recently found.'

"Baby I" will be officially released on September 23, 2016 on Chapter & Verse, the companion album to Springsteen's autobiography Born To Run.

No set details known. This was the grand-opening night at The Surf ‘N’ See Club. One show, double bill, with The Castiles opening for headliners The Rogues, who had been hired as the club’s house band for the months of July and August. As part of its job description The Rogues were to audition any local bands seeking work at the club. In the late morning The Castiles (hoping to land some future bookings) had auditioned for three of the six members of The Rogues (vocalist Thom White, drummer Mike Waters and guitarist John Waasdorp). Although they had not intended to have someone open for them on opening night, Rogues members Thom White and Mike Waters have told Brucebase that after listening to a couple of songs they told The Castiles “you might as well leave your equipment here, you’re opening for us tonight”.

Several other local area groups (including The Castiles) performed brief, 2 or 3 song sets but were not mentioned by name in the pre-concert ads.

No set details known. The Castiles perform at a school dance. It was around this time that organist Robert (Bob/Bobby) Alfano joined The Castiles. This 6-man lineup of the band with Alfano on organ (Line-up #4) would be the longest-lasting - until the band split in mid 1968. Alfano would go on to be a member of Springsteen’s next band, Earth as well. Prior to joining The Castiles Bob Alfano had been in the 1965-66 Freehold group The Rising Suns. He attended Freehold Regional High School as well (he was a year younger and one grade behind all the other members of The Castiles).

1966-11-00 - CAFÉ WHA?, NEW YORK CITY, NY

MY GENERATION

The Castiles audition at Café Wha?, which they pass. This sets in motion what would turn out to be an extensive series of about thirty shows at Café Wha? over the next fifteen months. Tex Vinyard mentioned in an interview that "My Generation" was the song that got the band the gig. The club, located at 115 MacDougal Street in the west village of New York City, opened in 1959. Under the guidance of owner/manager Manny Roth, it became a prominent, cutting edge musical venue during the 1960s. A plethora of famous musicians played there (many of them unknowns who were just getting started). The now legendary club still operates to this day in the same location as it did all those years ago. Bob Dylan’s first ever stage performance (a walk-on) in New York took place at the Café Wha in January 1961.

1966-11-11 - MATAWAN-KEYPORT ROLLER DROME, MATAWAN, NJ

No set details known. It was long thought that this was a Castiles show but it now believed that, in fact, they did not take part in the show. The mix up is due to one of the groups involved being called The Caste, a band formerly called The Crunchers, from Matawan Regional High School. The other bands to take part in this gig were The Shadows and The Clique. Each band played for about 1 hour.

1967-09-16 - THE LEFT FOOT, FREEHOLD, NJ

First set: FIRE (4:23) / SEE MY FRIENDS (4:31) / CATCH THE WIND (5:38) / OMAHA (2:51) / STEVE'S SONG (4:42) / JEFF'S BOOGIE (2:29)

Second set: PURPLE HAZE (4:27) / GET OUT OF MY LIFE, WOMAN (cut, 1:10) / HOLD ON, I'M COMIN' (5:41) / YOU CAN'T JUDGE A BOOK BY THE COVER (4:25) / ELEANOR RIGBY (6:46) / SUZANNE (cut, 4:11) / JEFF'S BOOGIE (2:51)

One show, double bill, with Purpul Dyneste opening and The Castiles headlining. Each band played two thirty-minute sets. This was grand opening night at The Left Foot, an "over 13, under 18" club located in the recreation centre of St Peter's Episcopal Church at 37 Throckmorton Street. The club was opened by Reverend George Errickson and Reverend Fred Coleman, along with two High School students, Harold Breiner and William Cottrell. Patrons sat on cushions. Sadly The Left Foot had a short existence (seven months). This was the first of only two live appearances by The Castiles at the club - fortunately both appearances were audience recorded by Left Foot Manager (and St Peter’s priest) Fred Coleman on a good quality reel-to reel device.

The above-mentioned thirteen-song setlist represents The Castiles’ complete song performance in the correct sequence and they are all covers of other artists’ material. The inspiration for often-covered “Get Out Of My Life, Woman” was the Paul Butterfield Blues Band version. Similarly the inspiration for Leonard Cohen’s “Suzanne” was the 1966 Judy Collins recording. Although Springsteen may have started out in mid-1965 singing mostly background vocals, it is clear that by this point Bruce is the band’s focal point. Bruce handles the lead vocals on all songs except “Eleanor Rigby”, The Kinks “See My Friends” and The Blues Project’s haunting “Steve’s Song” (all handled by George Theiss). Tex Vinyard, The Castiles’ manager, is heard introducing the band at the start of the second set. Interestingly the group uses The Yardbirds' instrumental “Jeff’s Boogie” twice, as both the first set closer and show closer.

The entire performance can be found by combining tracks three to eight on the CD boot 'The Bruce Springsteen Story, Vol 2' (E Street Records) with tracks one to seven on the CD boot 'The Bruce Springsteen Story, Vol 1' (E Street Records). The session details on this CD are not accurate. This bootlegger used a rough downstream generation source tape (running slower than the correct speed and with numerous short edits) and the sound quality is (at best) only fair. Two of the songs heard in the audio are cut prematurely, a flaw in the original master recording, not in later copying. However the sound quality of the original master tape (which does not readily circulate) is dramatically better (very good), with the vocals up front in the mix and good instrument separation.

A recording of Wille Dixon's "You Can't Judge A Book By The Cover" will be officially released on September 23, 2016 on Chapter & Verse, the companion album to Springsteen's autobiography Born To Run.

The rally was an attempt by some enterprising kids to start another teen club in the area. The news clipping is from the 21/9/67 edition of the ‘Asbury Park Press’.

1967-09-30 - THE LEFT FOOT, FREEHOLD, NJ

CIRCUS MARCH (cut, 0:08) / ONE BY ONE (2:56) / THE LETTER (2:19) / MR. JONES (3:22) / SAN FRANCISCAN NIGHTS (3:54) / OMAHA (2:49) / HEY JOE (cut 1:53) / MY GENERATION (2:50) / LOOK INTO MY WINDOW (cut, 1:49) / WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS - WINCHESTER CATHEDRAL (cut, 1:19) / WAKE ME, SHAKE ME (cut, 1:12) / MORNING DEW / Springsteen announcements (cut, 0:18) / TO LOVE SOMEBODY (cut, 0:13)

One show, double bill, with The Castiles headlining. This was the band’s second gig at the club (see September 16). The above-mentioned 13-song setlist represents The Castiles’ complete performance at this show, in the correct song sequence. George Theiss takes the lead vocal on “With A Little Help From My Friends”, “San Franciscan Nights” and “The Letter”. The former incorporates a brief instrumental rendition of “Winchester Cathedral” at the end. There were also two original compositions performed at this show. Bruce sings lead on “Mr Jones”, written by organist Bob Alfano. There is also a Springsteen/Theiss creation, “Look Into My Window”, with shared vocals. At one point Bruce calls for requests and someone shouts for “Sidewalk”, a Springsteen creation from 1965, however the band plays “San Franciscan Nights” instead. Besides the ancient traditional instrumental “Circus March”, other titles (with Springsteen lead vocals) include “Hey Joe”, “My Generation”, The Coasters’ “Wake Me Shake Me” and the evening’s encore, The Bee Gees “To Love Somebody”. This was The Castiles’ final appearance at The Left Foot. Although having only opened in September 1967, The Left Foot’s popularity dropped dramatically in March 1968 when the larger, trendier Freehold Hullabaloo club opened nearby. The Left Foot closed for good in April 1968.

As was the case two weeks earlier, St Peter’s priest Fred Coleman made an audience recording of the festivities. However the recorder was positioned in a different spot, so the recording did not come out as well as the first show. Unfortunately, one song was not recorded (a Springsteen vocal rendition of The Grateful Dead’s arrangement of the Tim Rose/Bonnie Dobson classic “Morning Dew”) and only very brief snippets of six of the other songs were captured. Consequently (and in contrast to the earlier show) only 26 minutes of the band’s 60-minute performance exists on the original master tape. Most of this show’s recorded audio (minus “Circus March”, “Wake Me, Shake Me”, the Springsteen announcements and “To Love Somebody”) can be found as tracks eight to sixteen on the CD boot 'The Bruce Springsteen Story, Vol 1' (E St). The session details on this CD are not accurate. This bootlegger used a rough downstream generation source tape (running slower than the correct speed) and therefore the sound quality is poor. The sound quality of the original master tape (which does not readily circulate) is considerably better (good), although not as nice as the master tape of the September 16, 1967 show.

No set details known. The date of this show is unknown and it may have taken place as late as mid-1968. However, it appears that photographs may show Paul Popkin wearing a poppy. The poppy is worn in America at the beginning of November, whilst Castiles bandmate Bart Haynes had died only days before, making this date entirely feasible. Springsteen can be seen playing a Fender Telecaster guitar in two of the photographs, the earliest known shots of Bruce with a Fender guitar.

One show, with The Castiles the sole act on the bill. On account of school vacation this was an unusual Wednesday night booking at the club. No confirmed setlist known from this particular show, but the four songs listed above are known to have been performed by The Castiles at a Le Teendezvous gig some time in late 1967. The four known songs include a cover of Vanilla Fudge's version of "Eleanor Rigby", Blues Magoos' "(We Ain't Got) Nothin' Yet" and The Doors' "Break On Through (To The Other Side)" and "The End".

This was the third and final Hullabaloo franchise to open in the area, the Middletown Hullabaloo having opened in 1966 and the Asbury Park Hullabaloo having opened in 1967. New evidence points towards the fact that The Castiles did not open this venue. The venue was actually opened on 22nd March by a group called The Fuzzy Bunnies. The MC for the evening was Screaming Lord Sutch.

1968-05-00 - OFF BROAD STREET COFFEE HOUSE, RED BANK, NJ

The Off Broad Street Coffee House opened in May 1968 to cater for the burgeoning singer-songwriter music scene taking hold at the time. The club also hired rock bands and provided open mike and hoot nights for aspiring talent of all types. Springsteen is known to have given several solo performances at the club during the May to October 1968 period. These performances included an array of folk orientated songs Bruce had written from late 1967 to mid-1968, material that didn’t fit into the rock setlists performed by The Castiles (and later Earth). The above-mentioned fifteen songs (all Springsteen originals) represent much of his original composition repertoire played at these solo shows during 1968. One of these songs, “Alone”, was co-written by Springsteen and Norman Luck (leader of the band Purpul Dyneste). The Springsteen songwriting style here bears some similarity to the 1967-68 material of Tim Buckley, Leonard Cohen and Donovan, and these artists songs were sometimes intermingled with Springsteen originals during the solo shows.

Sutch (with a backing band called 'The Beautiful Quality') was performing several club shows in the NJ shore area. George Theiss has confirmed to Brucebase that Sutch (known by some as ‘Screaming’ Lord Sutch) did indeed arrive at the Freehold Hullabaloo in his infamous 'hearse'.

The Castiles, who by mid-1968 were considered respected veterans within the local rock scene, were guest judges (not contestants) and also performed to close the show.

No set details known. One show, double bill, featuring The Castiles along with The Broadways. The Castiles had previously opened for The Broadways at a gig on December 22, 1967 but they closed this night’s show. The soul-influenced Broadways had evolved from a group called The Uniques that had a 1964 single (with Nick Addeo on lead vocals) on Norman Seldin’s Selsom Records label. Then, as The Broadways, they’d released two singles on the MGM label in 1966. The Broadways included vocalists Leon Trent (leader of the longtime Asbury Park based soul troupe Waterfront) and Billy Brown (who had several R&B hits in the 1970s with his group The Moments). Kirk Shorte, the lead guitarist in the backing band that supported The Broadways, informed Brucebase of this and the following week’s show.

1968-07-17 - OFF BROAD STREET COFFEE HOUSE, RED BANK, NJ

No set details known. Two shows, double bill, singer Jeannie Clark opening and The Castiles closing. The newspaper ad for this show is somewhat deceptive, as its billing (see above) 'Jeannie Clark and The Castiles' implies they performed together when in fact Jeannie performed separately as the undercard, she did not perform onstage with The Castiles at the show. Jeannie had recently left local band ‘Gross National Product’ in order to pursue a solo folk singing career. She would end up opening several shows for Springsteen in 1970-71 (see August 8, 1970, September 11, 1970, October 23, 1970, July 10, 1971) as well as being one of the ‘Zoomettes’ for the Dr Zoom & The Sonic Boom gigs in May 1971.

Off Broad Street Coffee House, Red Bank, NJ, 7-17-68
The first time I remember really setting eyes on Bruce Springsteen was at the Off Broad Street Coffee House, where I sang often in the late 1960s and early ‘70s. I knew he had a high school band, The Castiles, that rivaled my band from Middletown, the Gross National Product. He appeared shy, alone, and mysterious. His hair was long, or seemed long to a girl fresh out of high school in the 60s. I hadn’t seen hair like that on a guy, except for Bob Dylan’s bass player, when I saw him perform at Rutgers University. I didn’t have the courage to walk up and talk to Bruce, although I sensed that he had a soul deeper than the GI I was hanging with, sitting with a group around a table.

Both Curt Fluhr and Paul Popkin (both of whom are now deceased) decided to forgo musical careers.

The Start of the 'Earth' Era

1968-08-16 - OFF BROAD STREET COFFEE HOUSE, RED BANK, NJ

No set details known. Two shows (8:00pm and 10:15pm) featuring what is believed to have been the debut public performance of Springsteen’s new band 'Earth'. The initial lineup of the group consisted of Springsteen (guitars & vocals), John Graham (bass) and Michael Burke (drums) Organist Bob Alfano would soon be added to the line-up. It would be the foursome of Springsteen-Graham-Burke-Alfano that performed most of the gigs during the band’s brief, 6 month existence. Longtime confusion about whether Earth was a 3 piece or 4 piece group apparently stems from the fact that Bob Alfano occasionally had to miss gigs due to other commitments. All the members of Earth had initially met and jammed informally at The Off Broad Street Coffee House during spring and early summer of 1968. The new group was very blues-rock orientated, in the mould of then popular outfits such as Cream and John Mayall’s Bluesbreakers.

Springsteen (along with fellow Earth band members John Graham and Michael Burke) entered Ocean County College in September 1968. Bruce ended up staying for three semesters, dropping out in December 1969 shortly after his parents moved to California. Earth is believed to have performed several times at Ocean County College during the September to December 1968 period. Springsteen even contributed a piece of poetry to Seascapes, the school’s Literary Yearbook.

The twenty-six above mentioned songs are taken from the only known Earth-era repertoire listing (see photo). The document is likely to have been created by Springsteen in September or October 1968. The amount of tracks displayed, their sequencing, plus the header and numbering notation by Bruce, all point to this as being an inventory of Earth’s live repertoire of 'cover' material. For this reason it is of greater historical significance than an individual gig setlist, particularly in that no Earth audio is circulating.

A few of these songs are performance hold-overs from the The Castiles era. Since Earth was a three-piece band it’s hardly surprising that material from both Cream and The Jimi Hendrix Experience (the era’s two premier three-piece bands) are abundantly represented. Most are well known songs. However there are several obscurities, “Slow Blues in G” and ‘Fast Blues Break in G” are public domain titles, likely influenced by Eric Clapton’s arrangements during his 1965-66 Bluesbreakers period. There is also Donovan’s protest anthem “The War Drags On”, plus Cream’s “Swlabr” and "Toad”. “Help Me” is a track from Ten Years After’s 1967 debut LP. “The Morning: Another Morning” is courtesy of The Moody Blues. From a timeline standpoint the latest released song titles are Steppenwolf’s “Born To Be Wild” (July 1968) and Cream’s “Politician” (August 1968).

1968-09-28 - OFF BROAD STREET COFFEE HOUSE, RED BANK, NJ

FLY AGAINST THE WIND / HEY JOE / IT’S TOO LATE / THE EARTH IS BROKEN / CARNIVAL SONG / TROUBADOUR / WAYFARING STRANGER / INSIDE THE CASTLE WALLS / IF I NEEDED SOMEONE

Two shows, double bill, with Bruce Springsteen headlining and performing solo/acoustic and a folk group called The Founders opening. The newspaper ad (above) is somewhat deceiving, as it implies both acts performed together when in fact they performed separately. Some of the titles from the setlist are covers - “If I Needed Someone” is a Beatles tune, “Hey Joe” was covered by several artists in the mid-late 60s (most famously by Jimi Hendrix) and “Wayfaring Stranger” is a traditional song. “Fly Against The Wind” and “It’s Too Late” are titles we have been unable to match to any artists of the period. The remaining three, “The Earth Is Broken”, “Carnival Song” and “Troubadour”, are known 1967-68 songs titles by singer/songwriter Tim Buckley, a favorite of Springsteen’s at the time.

The above mentioned 9 song setlist emanates from an alleged 83 minute audience recording of Springsteen performing solo and live, sometime in 1968. The audio is not specifically linked to this show, details have been placed here merely as a logical reference point. A private collector claims to have this audio in their collection (obtained many, many years ago). The sound quality is alleged to be quite good. Brucebase was informed of the audio several years ago and was provided with basic details of titles/running time by the actual collector who claims to have it. However Brucebase has been unable to listen to even snippets of the audio and, as such, we cannot verify that the claim is genuine. Intriguingly however, one of the song titles provided, “Inside The Castle Walls” has subsequently turned out to be a verified Springsteen composition from this era (see May listing). The existence of this composition only became known in 2005, which lends some credence (but not compelling proof) to the claim the audio is real.
00Photo-32.png

1968-10-00 - OCEAN COUNTY COLLEGE, TOMS RIVER, NJ

No set details known. One show, featuring Earth. Held in the school’s Student Union 'Coffehouse'. According to some recollections Earth had a split musical personality - they played hard rock at some shows but at other gigs played softer, introspective, singer-songwriter material by the likes of Tim Buckley and Leonard Cohen (material that Bruce was also playing at his solo acoustic shows during this period). When Earth formed in August 1968 it did not have a promoter/manager for the first few weeks. However sometime during September they started being looked after by Francis “Fran” Duffy and Rick 'Spanky' Spachner (spelled Spaahner on some memorabilia). Both Duffy and Spachner ran a music and concert promotion and management business called 'Ooze & Oz Productions'. Other bands that were in the Ooze & Oz stable included Brother Duck, The Clique, Sidewalk Theory and Black River Circus.

1968-10-12 - HULLABALOO, FREEHOLD, NJ

It is unclear whether this gig ever took place. One advert shows Earth as the headliner, another showing The Electric Airplane. Given that the advert showing the latter was published on 11th October it is probable that Earth never performed at this show. Alternately this could be an error that was corrected in the later advert or, even more outlandishly, the band could have taken on this pseudonym for this one show.

1968-12-00 - FILLMORE EAST, NEW YORK CITY, NY

No set details known. Co-manager Francis Duffy is able to get Earth hired for a small band performance role in very low budget soft-core adult movie being made under the work-in-progress title of “N.Y.P.D. Now You’re Practically Dead”. This was not a public concert performance, as the film’s director apparently rented Bill Graham's Fillmore East as the shoot location. During Earth’s performance scene a naked girl dances onstage amongst Bruce and the band. People were having sex (or simulating it) on the lighting rig above Springsteen, and at one point underwear falls onto the end of his guitar. A brother of Earth bassist John Graham has confirmed to Brucebase that the events did indeed occur. The film was never released. The film’s director, the film company involved and the possible whereabouts of any surviving footage all remain a mystery. It is likely that this was a relatively major undertaking by the filmmakers as Bill Graham was hiring this venue out around this time for £3,000, a cost that would almost certainly have been beyond the reach of film students.

1968-12-20 - OFF BROAD STREET COFFEE HOUSE, RED BANK, NJ

No set details known. Two shows at 8pm and 10.30pm. This show is advertised under the headline 'Earthlings Dig the Earth', with the tag line 'It's a Real Earthquake.'
00News-32.png

1968-12-27 - LE TEENDEZVOUS, NEW SHREWSBURY, NJ

No set details known. One show, with Earth the sole act on the bill. The band performed a 2 hour show consisting of four 30 minute sets with intermissions between sets. At this show a new keyboard player, Frank "Flash" Craig, makes his debut, likely filling in for Bob Alfano. It is probable that the band wanted a keyboard player in place for the following night's show in New York City.

1968-12-28 - CRYSTAL BALLROOM, HOTEL DIPLOMAT, MANHATTAN, NY

No set details known. Two Ocean County College students book Earth and a band called Baker Street Division into this major, 1,800 seat venue. Who the two students are is unclear, but a newspaper report from the time notes that the event was organised by Ooze and Oz Productions (Fran Duffy and Rick Spachner), Joe McHugh of Atlantic Highlands and Underground News Media. The event was held in order to raise funds for a proposed new medical centre on the Lower East Side. Not only is the band completely unknown in the New York City area, but it is a long trip for the group's modest New Jersey fan base. Consequently a week or so prior to the show less than 100 tickets had been sold. With the student would-be promoters unable to get out of their contract with the hotel and facing financial disaster, support rallies are held on the OCC campus. The College administration chips in and organizes free bus transportation to all who buy tickets in advance. The rallies prove a success and the show turns out to be a near sell-out. The bus departs from The Inkwell in Long Branch, the bar where the name Steel Mill would later be born. Bruce has recounted this show as the largest crowd he'd performed in front of up to this point in his career, and the high point of Earth's tenure as a band. This was to be Frank "Flash" Craig's second and last show with Earth.

1969-01-00 - OCEAN COUNTY COLLEGE, TOMS RIVER, NJ

No set details known. One show, held in the Student Union, with Earth the sole act on the bill. It was during January 1969, the start of Bruce’s 2nd semester at OCC, that two Springsteen poems (“My Lady” and “untitled”) were published in Seascapes, the school’s Literary Yearbook. Bruce's name was misspelt "Sprengsteen". Click the link above to read the poems.

1969-02-14 - I.A.M.A. CLUBHOUSE, LONG BRANCH, NJ

No set details known. One show, billed as the 'St Valentines Day Massacre', with Earth the sole advertised act. The very rare posters (above) tell the story, this show was originally scheduled for the Paddock Lounge but was shifted to the larger IAMA (Italian American Mens Association) venue in order to accommodate strong ticket demand. Drummer Vini Lopez, looking to start a new band, attended this show to watch Bruce in action, setting in motion a chain of events that would quickly see the formation of new band Child. This was seemingly the last-ever Earth gig.

The Start of the 'Child - Steel Mill' Era

1969-02-22 - THE UPSTAGE, ASBURY PARK, NJ

ROCK ME BABY / IN-A-GADDA-DA-VIDA / HEAVY BERTHA / blues improvisation

No other set details known. An early morning jam session featuring Springsteen with Vinnie Roslin (bass) and Big Bad Bobby Williams (drums) for the first two songs noted above, including Iron Butterfly's In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida. Vini Lopez replaced Williams and Danny Federici also joined for an extended blues improvisation, which some suggest lasted some forty-five minutes. This would be the beginnings of a new band called Child (whose name would change to Steel Mill in late 1969). This event actually took place in the early hours of Sunday, February 23. The Upstage (click for a brief history of the early Upstage period) had opened for a business a year earlier (February 1968) and was steadily becoming a popular late night hangout for local musicians. Springsteen's first known performance at the famous club - he is known to have made at least thirty appearances before the Upstage closed in October 1971.

1969-03-13 - PANDEMONIUM, WANAMASSA, NJ

The legendary Pandemonium opened for business on February 14, 1969 and 'Jam Sessions’ (i.e. Talent Quests) were held on several Thursday evenings during the first couple of months of the club's operation. An event on this night is noted in the local paper as attracting “a variety of young local musicians”, some seeking an opportunity to receive paid bookings at the new club. It is believed that Springsteen, perhaps with some members of what was about to become (or had just become) Child, may have performed on this night. Whatever the exact details may be, Child would become hot property at the club within a few weeks.

1969-03-00 - CHALLENGER EASTERN SURFBOARDS, WANAMASSA, NJ

JENNIFER

Complete set details are not known. Child conducts it's first rehearsal at new manager Carl 'Tinker' West’s surfboard factory. Tinker, a legendary surfboard designer/shaper with San Diego based Challenger West Surfboards, had come to the Jersey shore in 1966 to set up a Challenger East business. Tinker (a guitarist and skilled harp player in his own right) had recently set up a concert promotion business called 'Blah Productions'. Tinker was interested in new artists who performed their own songs. It was Vini Lopez who knew Tinker and brought Bruce to meet him, resulting in Tinker agreeing to manage the group. Vini Lopez has mentioned the Springsteen composition “Jennifer” as one of the songs played at this Challenger rehearsal.

1969-04-02 - PANDEMONIUM, WANAMASSA, NJ

PROUD MARY (see notes below)

No set details known. One show, 9:30pm to 2.00am, with Child the sole act on the bill. A typical performance at this venue consisted of 4 or 5 sets with extended rest breaks in between (total onstage time about 2½ hours).

In his 1993 speech inducting Creedence Clearwater Revival into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall Of Fame, Springsteen tells of his nights with Child at Pandemonium: "In 1970 suburban New Jersey was still filled with the kind of sixties spirit Easy Rider made us all so fond of. I'm referring to the scene where Dennis Hopper gets blown off his motorcycle by some red-neck with a shotgun! A weekend outing at the time was still filled with the drama of possibly getting your ass kicked by a total stranger, who disagreed with your fashion sense. Me and my band worked on Route 35 outside of Asbury Park, at a club called the Pandemonium. They'd recently lowered the drinking age to eighteen with the logic that if you were old enough to die you were old enough to drink!

And so it was five 50 minute sets a night and rarely a night without a fight. The crowd was eclectic; rough kids just out of high school who hadn't been snatched up by the draft yet; Truck drivers heading home south to the Jersey pines who weren't gonna make it (not that night at least), and a mixture of college and working girls, women with bouffant hair-dos, and a small, but steady hippy contingent. Tough crowd to please all at once! We played behind a U-shaped bar that was just three feet and spitting distance from many of the patrons who came to just drink and stare and hassle the band.

Into New Jersey came the music of John and Tom Fogerty, Doug Clifford and Stu Cook - Creedence Clearwater Revival; and for three minutes and seven seconds of Proud Mary a very strained brotherhood would actually fill the room. It was simply a great song that everybody liked and it literally saved our asses on many occasions."

Springsteen isn't known to have played Pandemonium in 1970, so it's assumed he's talking about his residencies with Child in April, May, and July of 1969. Which shows he played "Proud Mary" at is unknown.

No set details known. Three shows (7.00pm, 10:30pm and 12:30am), double bill, with Child opening for headliner The James Cotton Band. This was the first time Pandemonium hosted a nationally known artist. The early show was reserved for minors (no alcohol). As the undercard Child’s performances were limited to about 45 minutes, although they probably played longer for the first show. An important early gig for Bruce, as the band recieved considerable exposure. See above for the photo of Springsteen and Federici standing in front of the large billboard poster for this show.

1969-06-01 - MONROE PARK, RICHMOND, VA

VOODOO CHILD / JENNIFER / CROWN LIQUOR

Complete set details are not known, although the three above-mentioned songs are from a fan recollection that's deemed reliable. "Jennifer" is a known Springsteen composition from the period that has yet to circulate on any tape. This is Child's first trip to Richmond and is a free outdoor concert. New Jersey band Brother Duck also make the trip and open the show. Child's performance here has a huge impact and many more trips to Richmond will follow over the next eighteen months. Mercy Flight drummer Davy Hazlett is in the audience. We've been contacted by a reader who recalled a guy sitting on a big water fountain which broke during the show - anyone else recall this? In a 1978 interview, Bruce also mentioned that the band played in North Carolina.

1969-06-07 - BLESSED SACRAMENT REGIONAL SCHOOL, MARGATE CITY, NJ

No set details known. One show (held in the gym), double bill, with Child headlining and Tracks opening. Apparently, this was a graduation dance concert for 8th graders orchestrated by the Blessed Sacrament Catholic Church, who ran this small private school located near Atlantic City. The lineup of Tracks included bassist Peter Sweval and drummer Jeff Grob (aka Joe Dube), both of whom would soon form the popular early 70s band Looking Glass and then pioneering late 70s metal outfit Starz.

This was the night that men first walked on the moon and numerous TV monitors were installed within the Club for the occasion. This created a major distraction during Child’s performance, which upset some of the band members. An ensuing argument over the issue took place between the band and the Club’s manager and this turned out to be the last ever Child gig at this establishment. Pandemonium eventually ceased operation in March 1971. The premises re-emerged under new ownership on May 28, 1971 as 'John Barleycorn', a Top 40 only disco. Norman Seldin & The Joyful Noyze (in its pre-Clarence Clemons incarnation) headlined at the John Barleycorn grand opening.

No set details known. One evening show with Child the sole act on the bill. This 3 day Child residency at the Student Prince coincided with the historic Woodstock Music Festival taking place in upstate New York (August 15th to 17th, and extended to the 18th). The band members wanted to attend Woodstock but were unable to due to these Student Prince gig commitments. However, Child’s manager/sound engineer, Tinker West, did manage to attend the festival. Interestingly Led Zeppelin were unable to perform at Woodstock due in part to a gig commitment at the Asbury Park Convention Hall on this same night.

A long-rumored Child gig, but in fact the group did not play and were never scheduled to. This was a double bill headlined by ‘Janis Joplin & The Kosmic Blues Band’ (fresh from her appearance at the Woodstock Festival), with the James Cotton Band opening the show. All the members of Child attended the show, along with Tinker West (also just back from Woodstock) they were guests of the James Cotton Band and hung out backstage with everyone after the show, but they did not perform.


1969-08-29 - OCEAN SIDE SURF CLUB, SEA BRIGHT, NJ

1969-09-19 - THE CENTER, FREE UNIVERSITY, RICHMOND, VA

No set details known. One show, with Child having sole billing. Held indoors at the University's 'Center' (a venue that would later change its name to 'The String Factory' in May 1970)
00Photo-32.png

1969-09-20 - THE CENTER, FREE UNIVERSITY, RICHMOND, VA

SISTER THERESA (3:52) / RESURRECTION (8:05) / GARDEN STATE PARKWAY BLUES (end cut, 19:34) / THE WAR IS OVER (11:10) / KT-88 (3:45) / GOIN' DOWN SLOW (15:22)

One show, held indoors at the University’s 'Center', with Child the lone act on the bill.

The above-mentioned setlist is taken from a circulating 62-minute indoor audience recording of only fair sound quality. This is currently the earliest known Child/Steel Mill audio in circulation. This audio first surfaced over 27 years ago but quickly became cannibalized in the tape trading pool. In 1977 two of these tracks (“Sister Theresa” and “Resurrection”) appeared on the vinyl boot “Resurrected” without any source information. The remainder of the audio has never been issued on any mainstream LP (or CD) boot and since the early 1980s has tended to circulate with tracks missing. Fortunately it has begun to circulate again in recent years on CDR in its original 62 minute edition. There are discernible edits between tracks and this is not the complete show, which is likely to have lasted about 90 minutes and included two or three additional songs. However it is all the audio from this gig that is known to exist. All songs are complete except for “Garden State Parkway Blues”, which is faded out prematurely and could be missing several minutes. “KT-88”, an instrumental, is introduced by Bruce as a new creation. This is the only circulating performance of “Sister Theresa” and the flute-like sound heard on this track (and others in this show) is a recorder being played by Vini Lopez. Over the years there has been considerable speculation regarding the time and location of this audio. The earliest traded specimens of this audio identified the source as a date unspecified 1969 gig at a Richmond club called 'The String Factory'. Since no verified gig date at The String Factory was found in any early timeline sources, some collectors began assigning the audio to other gig dates. Consequently this audio has been linked to a plethora of shows from 1969 and 1970. It turns out that the early source identification was fairly accurate. This material is indeed from 1969 in Richmond, but it’s from 'The Center', which changed its name to 'The String Factory' in the fall of 1970. This performance is prior to March 1970, as it features Vinnie Roslin on bass and background vocals. Although there were several shows at The Center during the Vinnie Roslin era, the sound of a heavy thunderstorm can be heard outside the building during “Garden State Parkway Blues” this allows the candidate gigs from the winter months to be eliminated. Note: this audio may be from the previous evening’s performance on September 19. Recording info: One, Two, Three. Audience tape (a.o. Flynn). Various versions circulate, including 'A Night Worth Spending In Richmond'.

1969-11-01 - VCU GYM, VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY, RICHMOND, VA

No set details known. One show, double bill, held in the Virginia Commonwealth University's Gym, with Child headlining and Richmond band Rain opening. Following this show the band returned to New Jersey only to learn that another progressive rock band from Long Island, NY was not only using the name 'Child', they’d also just released an album under that name on the Roulette Records label. Consequently, this November 1st gig is believed to have been the last gig performed prior to the band’s decision to change its name from Child to 'Steel Mill' (a name suggested by a friend of Vini Lopez). For the remainder of November and December, the group’s promotional material tended to incorporate both names in order to minimize confusion.

1969-11-14 - MONMOUTH COLLEGE, WEST LONG BRANCH, NJ

No set details known. One show, held outside the Student Union Building starting at 11.00am, with Child/Steel Mill performing a brief set. There were several folk singers that also performed short sets. This morning event was the start of Monmouth College’s day long Vietnam Peace Offensive, a prelude to the 2nd major National Moratorium demonstration held in Washington, DC the following day. At midnight rented buses were waiting to transport people down to Washington. It is believed that some (or all) members of Child/Steel Mill travelled in the buses to Washington.

1969-11-20 - THE CENTER, FREE UNIVERSITY, RICHMOND, VA

RESURRECTION / THE WAR IS OVER / RUN, SHAKER LIFE / SWEET MELINDA / YOU CAN'T ALWAYS GET WHAT YOU WANT

No other set details known. One show, with Steel Mill headlining and Mercy Flight opening for them for the first time (as substitutes for the billed Morning Disaster, who cancelled). Held indoors at the University's 'Center'. The partial setlist above is thanks to the recollections of attendees. Truxton Fulton sent his recollections: "I remember playing the Free U in the fall of 69, my freshman year at VCU. The name of my group was The American Band. Steel Mill was there. Morning Disaster may have been there too. I think we were a late addition and didn't make the poster. I played keyboard and bass piano (a la The Doors) This was the American Band's first gig and to the best I can remember, it's only gig. The other guys were from my hometown of Danville but after living in Richmond a while I pretty much got integrated with the the local musician set there. The guy running the Free U was a friendly guy named Russ Clem. I was very happy to use Steel Mill's Hammond B3 and I remember being very impressed with that keyboard guy -kind of on the chubby side, played great. They did a lot of songs I wasn't familiar with at the time: "The war is over", "Go down Moses, Go down David..." [Run, Shaker Life], "Sweet Melinda", they did a version of the Stones' "You Can't Always Get What You Want" which I hadn't heard at the time. They had just changed their name and Bruce explained that the name change was needless because the other Child had broken up. One thing that really impressed me was that when another band played, Bruce would be right off stage, really digging the other band's music. I thought that was very cool; they were, after all, the regional stars at the time. -and they sounded great; They had quite a following there in Richmond." It is unknown if Richie Haven's "Run, Shaker Life" is a single song or part of a medley, as at the Virginia Commonwealth University in May 1970. The set also includes the only known performance of The Rolling Stones' "You Can't Always Get What You Want".

1969-11-21 - CRENSHAW GYMNASIUM, RANDOLPH-MACON COLLEGE, ASHLAND, VA

No set details known. One show, triple billing, held in the school's 3,500 seat Crenshaw Gymnasium. Child/Steel Mill (who were paid $650) have second billing to headliner, Chicago Transit Authority (who were paid $3,000). Richmond band Natural Wildlife open the show. This concert had an unusual 'alternating sets' structure. Chicago performed two 45 minute sets and Child/Steel Mill played about 45 minutes after each of Chicago's sets. Very strange indeed. The concert was not a sellout. Press surrounding this show used the name Child, not Steel Mill, although posters may have been adjusted to accommodate the new band name. A contributor to an article on the Richmond Times-Dispatch website writes: "As a senior at Randolph-Macon College in 1970, I couldn't believe my good fortune that both Chicago and Iron Butterfly were to play our tiny college gym on the same weekend. Little did I know that Bruce Springsteen would also play on that weekend. I can't remember which of the superstar groups Steel Mill opened for, but I do recall that most of the post-weekend buzz was over the phenomenal performance of the leader of this virtually unknown group and not the heavy hitters who headlined."

1969-11-22 - CRENSHAW GYMNASIUM, RANDOLPH-MACON COLLEGE, ASHLAND, VA

No set details known. One show, triple billing, held in the school's 3,500 seat Crenshaw Gymnasium. This concert (the second in two nights) was part of a major sporting and cultural activities weekend at Randolph-Macon. Child/Steel Mill (who were paid $650) have second billing to headliner Iron Butterfly (who were paid a whopping $7,500 - that's substantial for this time period). Richmond band Natural Wildlife open the show. Unlike the previous night this concert had a traditional performing structure. Child/Steel Mill played about 60 to 70 minutes. The concert was not a sellout and lost money. One online blogger who attended this show has commented of Iron Butterfly that "Their performance was sloppy. They did a long version of their big song, but they were sleepwalking. I got the feeling that they were intimidated by Child's earlier performance".

Press surrounding this show used the name Child, not Steel Mill, although posters and handbills may have been adjusted to accommodate the name change.

1969-12-12 - MC GYM, MONMOUTH COLLEGE, WEST LONG BRANCH, NJ

No set details known. One show, 8:30pm, double bill, with Steel Mill headlining and Southern Conspiracy opening. The extremely rare gig specific custom poster (above) mentions “Steel Mill is Child under an assumed name”, an indication of the short-term confusion caused by the band’s forced name change. The show was put on by the Student Moratorium Committee and was an attempt to cover the costs of the anti-war events in October and November.

1969-12-20 - CHALLENGER EASTERN SURFBOARDS, WANAMASSA, NJ

No set details known. One show, with Steel Mill the sole act on the bill, a farewell gig prior to the band leaving on its much-anticipated trip to the west coast. Bassist Vinnie Roslin, in a Backstreets Magazine interview, has commented: "we had one last gig at Tinker's surfboard factory to raise enough money for the trip to California". The exact date of this show is unconfirmed.

1969-12-31 - ESALEN INSTITUTE, BIG SUR, CA

No set details known. One show, held outdoors at the Esalen Institute, a kind of hippy commune in the mountains of the Pacific coast. According to individual comments made by Springsteen, Lopez and Roslin this 'concert' was a New Year's Eve party that had been planned before the band arrived at Esalen. Sitting in with the band for their West Coast gigs was Richard Blackwell, a Freehold native that Springsteen had grown up with, and had found by chance staying at the Institute. The band hung around Big Sur for about a week (staying in a log cabin) before heading up to the San Francisco area.

THE WAR IS OVER (13.52) / LADY WALKING DOWN BY THE RIVER (9.59) / JEANNIE I WANT TO THANK YOU (9.47) / AMERICA UNDER FIRE - AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL (6.27) / HE'S GUILTY (THE JUDGE SONG) (7.09) / THE TRAIN SONG (6.48) / GOIN' DOWN SLOW (16.19)

One show, with Steel Mill the sole act on the bill. Boz Scaggs was the scheduled headliner but he cancelled at that last minute due to illness and so Steel Mill played alone. This is the show attended by critic Philip Elwood, who turned up intending to review Scaggs but ended up writing a highly favorable review of Steel Mill that appeared in the January 14 edition of The San Francisco Examiner. The above-noted setlist emanates from a long circulating, excellent quality soundboard audio from one of the California gigs. This is very likely (but not absolutely certain) to emanate from this January 13 show, as it seems to correspond closely to details noted in Elwood's article. Elwood mentions that the group opened with a brief warm-up instrumental rendition of "Satin Doll". However, the other tracks mentioned by Elwood do appear and the crowd noise corresponds with Elwood's 1984 comments that very few people were in attendance.

Soundboard recording, released in 1990 on the CD 'Live At The Matrix' (Great Dane Records) and LP 'Live At The Matrix' (Heart And Soul). "Satin Doll" doesn't appear on the circulating tape.

1970-02-10 - FILLMORE WEST, SAN FRANCISCO, CA

No set details known. The format this evening is uncertain - some say it was a single show with Steel Mill the sole act on the bill, while Springsteen himself says it was a multi-act gig, with up to six bands taking turns to play for an hour. In any case, this is the first of two performances at this venue during this early 1970 California trip. Owner Bill Graham had apparently seen one of Steel Mill's performances at The Matrix and subsequently contacted the group, hiring them as a last-minute substitute for another act that cancelled. Steel Mill impressed, and were invited back to perform another gig at Fillmore West the following week, a studio demo session and, lastly, a $1,000 retainer offer from Graham that the group declined.

1970-02-17 - FILLMORE WEST, SAN FRANCISCO, CA

No set details known. After impressing the previous week, Steel Mill return for another gig at Bill Graham's Fillmore West. Also on the bill that night were another up-and-coming young band, Maryland-based Grin, led by Nils Lofgren. Springsteen first met Nils at this time. The Grin/Steel Mill billing was recently noted and confirmed by Vini Lopez. In a 2002 interview for Backstreets magazine, Nils Lofgren said that both bands were there to audition for an opening slot at the venue along with around thirty other acts. Each act, according to Lofgren, played for twenty minutes.

1970-02-22 - PACIFIC RECORDING STUDIO, SAN MATEO, CA

HE'S GUILTY (THE JUDGE SONG) / GOIN’ BACK TO GEORGIA / THE TRAIN SONG

Steel Mill rehearsals at site and then formal recording of three Springsteen compositions and Bruce’s first time in a recording studio since a session with The Castiles in 1966 (see May 18, 1966 listing). After brief in-situ warm-up rehearsals, which weren’t recorded, the band recorded each song in one take. These were the only three songs rehearsed and the only three songs recorded. Pacific Recording Studios (also known as ‘Pacific Recorders’) was then located at 1737 S. El Camino Real, not too far from Springsteen’s parents’ home in San Mateo. This studio is perhaps best known as the place where both The Grateful Dead’s Aoxomoxa LP and Santana’s debut LP were recorded. Promoter Bill Graham, who at the time had recently started his fledgling ‘Fillmore Records’ label (Elvin Bishop and Cold Blood were among his initial signings), actually offered Steel Mill a contract, which the band rejected due to its poor terms and conditions.

"He's Guilty (The Judge Song)" has been officially issued in September 2016 on Chapter & Verse, the companion album to Springsteen's autobiography Born To Run.

1970-02-27 - THE CENTER, FREE UNIVERSITY, RICHMOND, VA

No set details known. One evening show, held at The Center, on Richmond's Free University campus, with Steel Mill the sole act on the bill. The band drove non-stop from California to Richmond to make it on time to this gig and they just made it. In a 1979 interview in the fanzine Thunder Road Vini Lopez commented: "we had to get back to Richmond in 3 days to do a gig. We made it. But that was a delirious show. I drove most of the way back, me and Tinker". This venue would be re-named The String Factory in May 1970.

1970-02-28 - THE CENTER, FREE UNIVERSITY, RICHMOND, VA

HE'S GUILTY (THE JUDGE SONG) / JEANNIE I WANT TO THANK YOU / YOU SAY YOU LOVE ME / CALIFORNIA BLUES / I AM THE DOCTOR / GOIN’ BACK TO GEORGIA / AMERICA UNDER FIRE / THE WAR IS OVER / ON THE ROAD / SWEET MELINDA / CROWN LIQUOR / LADY WALKING DOWN BY THE RIVER

One show, held at the school’s The Center (this venue will soon be renamed The String Factory in May 1970), with Steel Mill the sole act on the bill. The above mentioned twelve-song setlist is culled from a ninety minute-plus audience tape of the show that is in circulation. This is likely to represent most if not the entire show and it includes the only known audio of “You Say You Love Me” and “On The Road”, plus a rare performance of Billy Chinnock’s composition “Crown Liquor”. This gig is believed to have been bassist Vinnie Roslin’s final performance as a member of Steel Mill. His replacement will be Steve Van Zandt.

1970-03-00 - CHALLENGER EASTERN SURFBOARDS, WANAMASSA, NJ

Van Zandt had been a guitarist in The Whirlwinds (1964), The Mates (1965-66), The Shadows (1966-67), lead guitarist/vocalist in The Source (1967-69) and keyboardist in The Jaywalkers (1969-70) prior to joining Steel Mill.

1970-03-27 - HULLABALOO, RICHMOND, VA

No set details known. One show, with Steel Mill the sole act on the bill. This is the earliest verified public performance to feature new member Steve Van Zandt on bass. By 1970 the once-hip national Hullabaloo chain of discothèques had veered in a decidedly top 40 direction, far removed from the progressive rock of Steel Mill. Tom Yolton, guitarist for Richmond band Mercy Flight, has jokingly commented..."when word came out that Steel Mill was playing Hullabaloo everyone said...where the hell is that? It turned out it was well away from the VCU campus. It was a club with mirrors on the walls. I remember asking someone in the band about it later and getting some reply like "Oh man, did that suck...nobody was there and they wanted us to play dance music".

No set details known. A special promotional Steel Mill rehearsal performance designed to generate local publicity for the band in the wake of their California tour and Steve Van Zandt recently joining the lineup. A small group of local media personalities were invited to come and meet/chat with the band and watch them rehearse in an informal setting. One of the few journalists who actually turned up was Joan Pikula of the Asbury Park Press, who then wrote a nice article about the group that appeared in the paper a few days later (April 15, 1970). This was the first of what would turn out to be several positive articles/reviews from Pikula over the next fifteen months.

One show, with Steel Mill the sole act on the bill, performing before an audience of around 1,500. The above-mentioned partial setlist is from a review of the show by Joan Pikula that appeared in the April 20, 1970 edition of the Asbury Park Press. Several other songs were played but the titles were not mentioned in Pikula's review.

1970-04-24 - MONMOUTH COLLEGE, WEST LONG BRANCH, NJ

FUNKY BROADWAY - SOUL FREAKOUT (2:20) / HE'S GUILTY (THE JUDGE SONG) (7:58) / GOIN' BACK TO GEORGIA (5:31) / THE WIND AND THE RAIN (19:19) / RESURRECTION (13:28) / GARDEN STATE PARKWAY BLUES - SWEET BABY JAMES (29:40)

One show, with Steel Mill the sole act on the bill. This was a replacement concert for a cancellation of the musical "Hair". The above-mentioned setlist is taken from a circulating soundboard of very good to excellent quality, although end-user quality tends to vary widely due to the fact the material has been in circulation for over twenty years and some circulating copies are many generations downstream. This six-song, 78-minute segment of audio, long referred to in collector circles as 'the West End gig', would have to rank as the most misidentified, misdated and cannibalized of all Springsteen recordings. To make matters even messier though, the show's epic 30-minute finale, "Garden State Parkway Blues", is sometimes edited into separate segments and assigned invented titles such as "Mountain Child", "I Got A Woman" or "Sunlight Soldiers".

Many LP and CD bootlegs (such as 'Torn and Frayed', 'The Bruce Springsteen Story, Vol 3' and 'Deep Down In The Vaults') contain one, two or several of these tracks, assigned to a wide variety of incorrect dates/venues. However 'Sunlight Soldiers At The West End' (Rattlesnake) includes the complete audio and merely messes up the correct date/venue. This soundboard tape is very deceptive in that drummer Vini Lopez's voice microphone is abnormally dominant in the mix, so much so that it sounds like a co-lead singer (i.e., Robbin Thompson) is interacting with Springsteen throughout the show. However under an extremely close comparison it can be determined that the 'co-lead' vocalist is actually drummer and background vocalist Lopez, with his microphone turned way up in the audio mix. Robbin Thompson’s voice is definitely not present. There are three critical clues during the performance that, when combined, powerfully point to the true location and date of this show. Firstly, Bruce’s dedication to the "West End Fire Department" signifies a Long Branch or close proximity location. Secondly, the distinct sound of wooden side bleachers being stomped during the final song signifies it’s indoors and it's a gymnasium (not a theatre or concert hall). Thirdly, Bruce recites the opening line of James Taylor's song "Sweet Baby James" during "Garden State Parkway Blues" this places the show no sooner than late March, 1970. Consequently this audio can, to a high degree of probability, be identified as coming from this April 24 show.

1970-05-02 - KENAN STADIUM, UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA, CHAPEL HILL, NC

Cancelled Steel Mill performance. This was a three-day, multi-artist outdoor music festival held in the school’s 40,000 seat Kenan Stadium, running from 1-3 May. Many attendees camped around or in the vicinity of the venue, creating a ‘mini-Woodstock’ atmosphere. The major headliners for the event were Joe Cocker and James Taylor. Although Steel Mill were not booked to play, the guys hatched a brazen plan whereby they would sneak their equipment van (and themselves) into the venue, pretend they were one of the scheduled acts, set up their equipment and just start playing to the crowd! Hilariously they managed to beat security, get in and start setting up their sound system several hours before James Taylor’s afternoon appearance, only to be thwarted at the very last minute when they were just about to start playing. They were then thrown out. The additional information on the dates of the concert is provided by the Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library.

1970-05-10 - MONMOUTH COLLEGE, WEST LONG BRANCH, NJ

One show, double bill, with Steel Mill headlining and Mercy Flight opening. This was an end of the school term, 2.00pm, outdoor show. Set details are unconfirmed, although there are recollections that "For What It's Worth", "He's Guilty (The Judge Song)", "I Am The Doctor" and "Resurrection" were among the songs performed. This gig took place several days after the tragic shooting of students at Kent State University in Ohio. It's now suspected this fully documented May 10th show is the true source and date of the long-rumored May 4th 'Kent State' tribute gig that allegedly took place at the college. The May 4th date does not match historical information in the school’s archives.

It should also be noted that the circulating audio from the April 24 show at Monmouth may possibly be from this show.

1970-05-23 - VCU GYM, VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY, RICHMOND, VA

KT-88 (4:13) / JEANNIE I WANT TO THANK YOU (9:07) / I AM THE DOCTOR (7:31) / SOMETHING'S GOTTA BREAK (8:00) / TEMPORARILY OUT OF ORDER (6:49) / SWEET MELINDA (5:47) / COME ON (4:30) / RESURRECTION (11:10) / AMPLIFIER BLUES (9:29) / FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH - RUN, SHAKER LIFE - TWENTY MORE MILES (end cut, 12:59)

One show, double bill, held in the VCU Gym, with Steel Mill headlining and Mercy Flight opening. This gig is infamous because it ended with Vini Lopez arrested for unruly behaviour.

The above-noted setlist is culled from a circulating 80-minute audience recording of only fair quality. There are continuity cuts between most songs. This is not the complete show, which contained at least twenty minutes more music (two to four songs). This audio has never appeared on any mainstream bootleg but does circulate via various custom sources, some with between-song chatter deleted or songs missing. This audio is sometimes attributed to an alleged gig at VCU Gym on May 16. However VCU’s archives don’t indicate any show on that date. Comments made by Springsteen during the show point to the audio as being from the documented May 23 VCU gig. Mercy Flight’s co-manager, Russell Clem, can be heard introducing Steel Mill. During the middle of the country-rock inspired “I Am The Doctor”, Springsteen tells the crowd "we went swimming today down in the James River [outside Richmond] and we took our surfboards with us". During the intro to "Resurrection", Springsteen mentions canoeing earlier that afternoon. Bruce sings, "here we are back in Richmond, Virginia again" as the opening line of "Amplifier Blues". Earliest known performances for "Something's Gotta Break" and "Come On", and only known versions of "Temporarily Out Of Order", "Amplifier Blues", and "For What It's Worth". From the outset of this show there were problems with the school's generators. There was a power outage during Mercy Flight's opening tune, "Mississippi Queen" and the problems continued intermittently for the remainder of the evening. This, combined with VCU officials' complaints about the loudness of Steel Mill's performance, caused tension between the band and officials. Springsteen and Lopez can be heard making related comments during the show. Following "Jeannie I Want To Thank You" Bruce remarks to the crowd "there's a weird thing going on between your officials and us". At another point Bruce can be heard exclaiming “there should be no restrictions on me”. At another point Bruce tells the crowd "we're gonna finish this one with you guys and split to the middle of the road and play". Despite the drama the audience is enthusiastic and the band's performance is excellent. The MC's comments and opening instrumental are in the correcting performing order. The rest of the audio is in its likely running order. Although it has not surfaced as part of the circulating audio, there is attendee recollection that “He's Guilty (The Judge Song)” was performed following the opening instrumental "KT-88" (there's an edit so this is plausible). All songs are complete except for the final song, which is cut prematurely close to its true conclusion. It is likely there was another song played after "Twenty More Miles" that's missing from the audio source, and it would seem it was during that point that VCU officials shut the band’s power off as they overran the 11:00pm curfew. Lopez in an act of defiance continued playing his drums, which resulted in him being hauled way for disorderly conduct, an incident that Vini has jokingly referred to in several interviews.

1970-06-05 - REGENCY HOTEL, LAKEWOOD, NJ

No set details known. One show, double-bill, with Steel Mill headlining (but playing first) and Mercy Flight closing. This was a private function 'The 1970 Rumson-Fairhaven Regional High School Junior-Senior Prom'. Steel Mill opened at 9:30pm and played a 1¾ hr show consisting of their usual self-penned material. After a short intermission, Mercy Flight came out and played a 1¾ hr show consisting of dance/top-40 covers (not their usual setlist). Festivities ended at 2.00am.

GUILTY (minor cuts, 9:04) / COME ON (4:30) / KT-88 (3:28) / BLACK SUN RISING (8:11) / I AM THE DOCTOR (5:36) / JEANNIE I WANT TO THANK YOU (fades, 7:37) / SOMETHING'S GOTTA BREAK (7:21) / GARDEN STATE PARKWAY BLUES (cut, 5:12)

Two shows, double bill, with Steel Mill opening for headliner Grand Funk Railroad. Bruce and the boys were a late substitution for Detroit's now-legendary MC5 (who, ironically, had just released an album produced by Jon Landau). There was no time to print new tickets to reflect the billing change, as evidenced by the ticket scan.

The above-mentioned eight-song setlist is from a circulating audience audio source (weak quality) and is likely to represent the complete performance. An announcer can clearly be heard at the beginning explaining to the audience that the MC5 are delayed in Connecticut and, as such, Steel Mill will be playing instead. These remarks positively link this performance to this venue and date. Nothing in the audio identifies if this is the early or late show. This material is often identified as being from a variety of incorrect shows, notably February 1970 in Richmond. There is a concert review in the June 15 Asbury Park Evening News that probably relates to this concert, anyone who may have the chance to get a scan of this please get in touch.

No other set details known. One show, with Steel Mill the sole act on the bill. This venue had previously been owned and operated by Free University under the name "The Center" and Child/Steel Mill had played here several times (see listings). It was sold in March 1970 and re-opened, revamped and under private ownership, in May 1970 as "The String Factory".

In November 2013 a fair quality audience recording of "Where Was Jesus In Ohio" surfaced, followed shortly after by a twenty minute "Garden State Parkway Blues". The former is Springsteen's response to the May 4, 1970 massacre at Kent State University in Kent, Ohio. Performed by Springsteen alone with an acoustic guitar, it's an early example of Springsteen moving away from his band, as his focus switches to solo material over the next few years. The exact detail of this tape is not clear at the moment, we don't believe the tape is complete and it is not currently in mainstream circulation. While this song was performed solo, the taper confirms this was a Steel Mill show; the band took a break while Springsteen played alone. We have placed this audio here since we understand it was recorded at The String Factory, but it may emanate from the next night, or potentially other unrecorded shows. Brucebase reader Tom Eure contacted us about a show at The String Factory he vividly recalled. He remembers Springsteen playing with nothing on but a pair of jeans, in hot, humid conditions while a massive thunderstorm raged outside. The audience were sat on the floor, watching mesmerised as the stage was periodically lit by flashes of lightning. The room was surrounded by large windows, making the light show all the more impressive. The unmistakable sounds of thunder can clearly be heard (as can the audience reaction) during the quiet sections of "Garden State Parkway Blues", suggesting this may be the show that made such an impression on Tom.

This show is postponed due to heavy rain. It is rescheduled to the following evening.

1970-06-22 - CLEARWATER SWIM CLUB, ATLANTIC HIGHLANDS, NJ

No set details known. One outdoor evening show, double bill, with Steel Mill headlining and Glory Road opening (whose line-up includes Garry Tallent and Bill Chinnock). As can be seen in the press report, the audience of around 4,000 was almost certainly the largest Springsteen had played in front of up to this point in his career. Despite some pre-event complaints by local residents, the show ended without incident about 1.00am and was deemed a major commercial success by the Swim Club owners, who immediately began organizing a similar event for the end of summer (see September 11).

Please note that audio once incorrectly attributed to this show can now be found under the listing for July 17.

1970-07-17 - SUNSHINE IN, ASBURY PARK, NJ

DANCING IN THE STREET (10:50) / COME ON (4:45) / SHERLOCK GOES HOLMES (9:44) / GARDEN STATE PARKWAY BLUES (27:25) / RUN, SHAKER LIFE (end cut, 4:10)

One show, double bill, with Steel Mill headlining and Lotus opening.

The above-mentioned partial setlist is taken from a circulating 58-minute soundboard recording of good-very good quality. This audio has only partially circulated on a vinyl bootleg "Don't Sweat It" in limited quantities and in poor quality. It is circulating in complete form via private CDR sources (usually identified only as "summer 1970" or "mid-1970" or "unknown location"). The audio seems to include the first three songs of the night and the final two songs, with "Run, Shaker Life" cut very prematurely. This would represent only about half of a normal show's length. Following a nice show-opening "Dancing In The Street" Springsteen jokingly comments "It's all happening out there in the street, so what are we doing in here?" During the epic "Garden State Parkway Blues", Bruce mentions driving through Ocean Grove on a Sunday, as well as the fireworks at the Freehold Raceway, both comments draw a noticeable crowd reaction. These comments indicate this audio is from an indoor summertime performance in the Asbury Park area. When combining the sound of the audience size, the track listing and the very limited gig bookings the band had during the summer of 1970 there is a strong likelihood this audio is from either this night or the following night's show at the same venue.

1970-07-18 - SUNSHINE IN, ASBURY PARK, NJ

Set details unknown. One show, with Steel Mill headlining and Lotus as the support band.

1970-07-27 - THE UPSTAGE, ASBURY PARK, NJ

No set details known. A rare performance by Funky Dusty & The Soul Broom, a short-lived (summer-fall 1970) 4 piece band consisting of Steve Van Zandt ("Funky Dusty"), Garry Tallent, "Southside" Johnny Lyon and drummer Bobby Williams ("The Soul Broom"). Apparently, Springsteen was in attendance and joined in a late evening jam. At this point in mid-1970, both Tallent and Williams were full-time members of Glory Road (along with David Sancious and Bill Chinnock), Van Zandt was a member of Steel Mill and Southside was a free agent, having recently left his former band Maelstrom. The Funky Dusty & The Soul Broom side-project was a catalyst for what became The Big Bad Bobby Williams Band in late 1970 and Sundance Blues Band in spring 1971. Funky Dusty & The Soul Broom were singer Jeannie Clark’s backing band at the infamous Clearwater gig on September 11.

1970-08-08 - THE BEACHCOMBER, LONG BRANCH, NJ

Cancelled concert, never re-scheduled. This all-day, outdoor event was supposed to feature Steel Mill as headliner and three or four support acts, including Mercy Flight and Jeannie Clark. So the "1st Annual Nothings Festival" turned out to be just... nothing!

1970-08-14 - 7TH AND MARSHALL STREET PARKING DECK, RICHMOND, VA

DANCING IN THE STREET (8:20) / COME ON (4:30) / KT-88 (3:50) / THE WAR IS OVER (14:28) / WHY'D YOU DO THAT (6:14) / SHERLOCK GOES HOLMES (9:46) / GOIN' BACK TO GEORGIA (5:18) / RESURRECTION (13:52) / HE'S GUILTY (THE JUDGE SONG) (7:58) / WE'LL ALL MAN THE GUNS (11:26) / RUN, SHAKER LIFE - TWENTY MORE MILES (14:43) / GOOD LOVIN' WOMAN (9:34)

One show, triple bill, with blues band Marlo Mays & The Stingers opening, Mercy Flight performing second and Steel Mill headlining and closing. Held under the stars on the upper deck of the parking complex. The general concept for this show was modeled after The Beatles memorable rooftop performance in the film "Let It Be" (which was in theatres at the time). This is one the most famous of all Steel Mill’s gigs and it’s now firmly a part of Richmond folklore. Promoter Russell Clem provides the immortal MC introduction. This was Steel Mill’s first gig in about a month and their performance actually starts off somewhat ragged as a result, something both Bruce and Vini Lopez apologize for this during the show. A day or so after this show Springsteen met privately with Mercy Flight's lead singer Robbin Thompson and offered him a position in Steel Mill. After a few days of deliberation, Thompson accepted the offer, resigning from Mercy Flight on August 23 and relocating to New Jersey to join Steel Mill the following week.

The above-mentioned 12-song setlist is culled from audio from this show that circulates in several variations. An audience tape of only fair quality has been in circulation for many years. Fortunately, a substantially better (very good) quality and more complete specimen of this audience recording has emerged in the collector market over the past couple of years and is absolutely worth obtaining. In addition to the new audience source, some soundboard audio has also emerged from this show. The soundboard audio is missing two tracks ("The War Is Over" and "He's Guilty (The Judge Song)") found on the audience recording and the soundboard quality isn't nearly as good as the better of the two audience sources. Importantly, though, the soundboard audio includes the show's encore "Good Lovin' Woman", which is not found on the audience audio. The soundboard audio can be found on CDR 'Last Show From Richmond' (Vintage Masters). The 12-song, 110-minute setlist is not the complete show. It would appear that the audience audio is complete up to and including “We’ll All Man The Guns”. There is then a two- to four-song segment of the show that has never circulated from any source. One of the songs definitely performed during this “missing” segment was “The Wind And The Rain”. Both "I Am The Doctor" and "Sweet Melinda" have cropped up in attendee recollections and may have also filled this gap in this show. From a historical standpoint, the two most important tracks are "We'll All Man The Guns" (Bruce introduces it as just written) and Bruce's 1969 song "Good Lovin' Woman" (Bruce introduces it as "an old song"). Neither of these two songs is available elsewhere.

1970-08-25 - CHALLENGER EASTERN SURFBOARDS, WANAMASSA, NJ

DANCING IN THE STREET / GOIN' BACK TO GEORGIA / HE'S GUILTY (THE JUDGE SONG) / TRAIN RIDE (Thompson)

No set details known. Formal hiring of new Steel Mill vocalist Robbin Thompson and three days of intense rehearsals at Challenger in preparation for the Steel Mill concert at the upcoming Nashville Music Festival. Robbin, a Florida native, had been lead singer (and songwriter) in popular Florida-based bands The Hanging Five (1963-4), The Five Gents (1964-5), The Tasmanians (1966-7) and Transcontinental Mercy Flight (1968) before relocating from Florida to Richmond in early 1969 and forming Mercy Flight. The songs listed were noted by Robbin Thompson.

1970-08-29 - CENTENNIAL PARK BAND SHELL, NASHVILLE, TN

HE'S GUILTY (THE JUDGE SONG)

No set details known. One show, a morning until late evening outdoor extravaganza 'The 3rd Annual Nashville Music Festival', sponsored by popular city radio station WMAC. This was an outdoor event, with the artists performing inside the Centennial Park Band Shell. About 20 different artists took part, ranging in style from traditional country to progressive hard rock. Headliners included Roy Orbison, Brian Hyland, Ronnie Milsap, Bobby Bloom and rock bands Ballin' Jack, Ten Wheel Drive and Illusion. Steel Mill was one of only a couple of acts on the bill without a record contract, some college students with connections on the festival’s organizing committee had seen Steel Mill perform previously in Richmond and helped the band procure a slot on the bill. The weather was lovely and the crowd was about 50,000, the largest audience Springsteen would play in front of until the 1980s. Springsteen famously recalled this show in his speech inducting Roy Orbison into the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame in 1987..."In 1970 I rode for 15 hours in the back of a U-Haul truck to open for Roy Orbison at the Nashville Music Fair. It was a summer night and I was 20 years old and he came out in dark glasses, a dark suit and he played some dark music." An attendee at this concert specifically remembers "He's Guilty (The Judge Song)" (aka "He's Guilty (Send That Boy To Jail) as having been played.

1970-09-06 - CHALLENGER EASTERN SURFBOARDS, WANAMASSA, NJ

No set details known. First of several days of Steel Mill rehearsals for the upcoming September 11th Clearwater Swim Club show, featuring Mercy Flight drummer Dave Hazlett, who has come up from Richmond on short notice to be a temporary fill-in for drummer Vini Lopez, who is stuck in Richmond sorting out legal difficulties.
00Photo-32.png00News-32.png

1970-09-11 - CLEARWATER SWIM CLUB, ATLANTIC HIGHLANDS, NJ

No set details known. One five hour show, held outdoors, with Steel Mill headlining a quadruple billing featuring support bands Task, Sid's Farm and local folk singer Jeannie Clark (with her backing band consisting of Steve Van Zandt, Garry Tallent and Southside Johnny). A gig now steeped in folklore. In Steel Mill's lineup for this show was drummer Dave Hazlett (from vocalist Robbin Thompson’s former band Mercy Flight). Hazlett had come up from Richmond to fill in for the absent Vini Lopez, who was stuck in Richmond due to a marijuana bust on a communal property where Vini’s then-girlfriend lived (everyone in the commune were charged - Vini was merely in the wrong place at the wrong time). Steel Mill was intending to use its earnings from this show to help defray Vini’s legal costs. So the unique Steel Mill lineup for this Clearwater gig was Springsteen, Van Zandt, Federici, Thompson and Hazlett.

Steel Mill had played a similar event at this venue in June that had gone smoothly. However some local residents had subsequently complained to town officials about the noise level so late at night, this resulted in the curfew time for the September concert being lowered from 11.00pm to 10.00pm, as well as a much stronger police presence. Several audience arrests for marijuana possession raised tensions in the crowd. Then when 10.00pm came around (Steel Mill was part way through its set) the police took a hard line about the curfew and switched off the power to the instruments, infuriating the crowd. Several members of the band then plugged into overhead light sockets, forcing the police to enter the stage and ask the band to stop playing, which then escalated the crowd into a near-riot. During the ensuing mayhem, some sound equipment fell onto the local Chief of Police (who was very slightly injured). Danny Federici earned his famous nickname of 'The Phantom' by disappearing from the melee with lightning speed. However, news reports in the days after say that police were searching for Federici, charged with assault on a police officer and resisting arrest. 21 people were arrested for a mixture of drug and assault charges and ten policemen were injured. The aftermath of this show was extensively covered in the local media at the time. Danny eventually turned himself in and was bailed in November 1970. This show was filmed, but unfortunately, the resulting recording was subsequently lost in a fire.

Springsteen spoke about the events at Clearwater Swim Club during his eulogy to Danny Federici in 2008. Click here to read a transcription of the eulogy.

"I was doing my set on a small stage away from the main concert. Steve, Garry and Johnny (Funky Dusty & The Soul Broom) were backing me up. I was wearing a mink wrap with heads and tails still attached that my crazy Uncle Lenny gave me. The wrap really grossed-out my friends, Rob and Paul, but I thought it was a very Janis Joplin thing to wear. She also had a great influence on my singing style then. That was one of the best times, musically, that I remember."

1970-09-19 - BEACON BEACH, POINT PLEASANT BEACH, NJ

One show, a daytime double bill held on the beach in front of the Beacon Manor motel, featuring Sid's Farm and local folk duo Jack And Vern. This hastily organized, word-of-mouth-only concert was put together to raise funds to help defray the legal costs of individuals arrested at the September 11 Clearwater gig. Although long listed as a Steel Mill concert date neither Steel Mill or any of its band members performed at this gig. However, Steel Mill did donate its sound equipment for use at the show. It is speculated that Steel Mill may have initially contemplated performing but backed out due to the unavailability of Danny Federici and/or Vini Lopez. This show went off without incident and $200 in donations was raised.

1970-10-11 - THE MOSQUE, RICHMOND, VA

I CAN’T TAKE IT NO MORE / WHY'D YOU DO THAT / SHERLOCK GOES HOLMES / GOIN' BACK TO GEORGIA

One show, double bill, with Steel Mill opening for headliner The Ike And Tina Turner Revue. A soul band and a progressive rock group were a strange billing combination, consequently, it’s perhaps not surprising that less than half the tickets to the 3,000-seat Mosque were sold. Former Back Door Club owner John Richardson, who orchestrated the event, has stated that he lost a fair chunk of money on this show.

The above-mentioned setlist is taken from a circulating 29-minute audience recording of only fair quality. This audio has not been issued on any mainstream commercial boot but is circulating via custom sources, sometimes with the venue/date unidentified. As undercard Steel Mill would have played about 60-70 minutes, so there are likely three to five songs missing from the circulating audio. The audio evidence supports reports that the venue was half empty. The crowd reaction to Steel Mill is polite but indifferent, an indicator the band wasn’t headlining. "Why'd You Do That" includes a customized refrain mentioning the town of Woodland Falls that seems to have been used only when playing in Virginia. “Goin’ Back To Georgia” features Bruce and Robbin Thompson alternating the lead vocal.

1970-10-17 - MC GYM, MONMOUTH COLLEGE, WEST LONG BRANCH, NJ

HE'S GUILTY (THE JUDGE SONG) / DANCING IN THE STREET / GOIN' BACK TO GEORGIA / CHANGING CHILDREN / GARDEN STATE PARKWAY BLUES / I CAN’T TAKE IT NO MORE / TRAIN RIDE / RESURRECTION

One show, double bill, with Steel Mill headlining and Sunny Jim opening. The above-noted partial setlist is culled from a review of the show by Joan Pikula in the Asbury Park Press on October 19, 1970, and Springsteen's own recollection of the opening song in his autobiography Born To Run. Despite being on the lam after events at the Clearwater Swim Club on September 11, Danny Federici decides to take the chance and play at what is an important show for the band. Despite smoking himself into a mild state of paranoia in the car before the show, Danny made it through the gig and out unscathed. However, he was persuaded to turn himself in soon after. A sellout performance in the College’s Gym, with a crowd that Pikula estimates at near 4,000. This was the debut public performance of Sunny Jim, a group formed in May 1970 that included former Castiles drummer Vinnie Manniello and former Castiles and Earth organist Bob Alfano. "Changing Children" is also known by the titles "Change It" and "Change It (Revolution)".

No circulating audio.

1970-10-23 - MILLHISER GYMNASIUM, UNIVERSITY OF RICHMOND, RICHMOND, VA

Set details unknown. One show with Steel Mill headlining and New Jersey folk singer Jeannie Clark supporting. This is the first of three shows played during a massive road trip from Richmond to Nashville and back. It has been mentioned in an interview by Robbin Thompson.

The text below is copyrighted to Jeannie Clark Fisher.
"I rode down to the gig in Tinker’s truck. We stopped at a gas station and I bought a packaged cupcake with cinnamon crumb topping. Tinker made me look at the ingredients and he gave me a lecture about all the chemical junk it had in it. He seemed very ahead of his time to me with his California awareness of nutritional issues. I opened the show for Steel Mill at the University of Richmond standing on one end of the gymnasium, playing my guitar and singing to a crowd of students, all sitting on the floor. The music went well, but I was starting to get the sense that the lone, folk troubadour was not going to have as vast an audience as it had in the ‘60s. The times were changing again."

1970-10-24 - NASHVILLE MUNICIPAL AUDITORIUM, NASHVILLE, TN

HE'S GUILTY (THE JUDGE SONG)

After the show at the Centennial Park Band Shell on August 29 a number of bands were invited back to perform in this 'Best of the Bands'. One attendee remembers Vini Lopez playing with short hair, and that the song "He's Guilty (The Judge Song)", was played.

No known audio.


1970-10-25 - RICHMOND ARENA, RICHMOND, VA

No set details known. One show, quadruple billing, featuring Steel Mill, Big Brother, Feast and S.R.C. The headliner, S.R.C., was a Detroit-based outfit that, at the time, had three weak selling LPs out on Capitol Records, as well as a classic 60s garage-type single "Black Sheep, Black Sheep". S.R.C. is probably best known via its earlier mid-60s incarnation called The Fugitives.

1970-11-25 - STUDENT CENTER, NEWARK STATE COLLEGE, UNION, NJ

No set details known. One show, double bill, with Steel Mill headlining and Institution opening. This was a 9.00pm - 1.00am show, so Steel Mill must have played at least 2 hours.
00Photo-32.png

1970-11-27 - SUNSHINE IN, ASBURY PARK, NJ

Early show: DANCING IN THE STREET (13:49) / WE'VE GOT TO DO IT NOW (13:15) / I CAN'T TAKE IT NO MORE (9:07) / OH MAMA (4:25) / CHANGING CHILDREN (9:58) / I GOTTA BE FREE - TURN ON YOUR LOVE LIGHT (11:27) / TRAIN RIDE (13:49)

Two shows, triple bill, with the bottom-billed Steel Mill opening for the second-billed Cactus and headliner Black Sabbath (fronted by a spooked Ozzy Osbourne, who received death threats before the show). According to Robbin Thompson the members of Black Sabbath and Cactus had a fistfight over who should close the show.

The above-mentioned seven-song setlist comes from an excellent audio quality soundboard and represents the complete 76-minute performance from the early show, with no continuity breaks in the audio. This is not Steel Mill at its best, but it does contain the previously uncirculated "We've Got To Do It Now". Previous information suggested the title of this song was merely "Do It Now", but a lyric sheet with the full title emerged recently. The original master tape had the recording date on it and, additionally, there is verifying commentary by Robbin Thompson during the performance. About eight minutes into "Dancing In The Street" the generator power fails for 12 seconds, much to the frustration of Bruce who comments "we must be the guinea pigs here tonight". According to an attendee recollection, each of the three bands played similar length sets. After the end of the evening, Springsteen spent about an hour backstage jamming with Cactus bassist Tim Bogart. There is no circulating audio from the late show.

1970-12-00 - UNKNOWN CLUB, SAN MATEO, CA

No details known. Springsteen travelled to California by car in December 1970 to visit his parents and young sister Pamela. Information is sketchy, but apparently, Bruce may have performed/jammed with some local musicians at club(s) in the San Mateo area during the 2-3 weeks he was visiting.

1971-01-08 - THE UPSTAGE, ASBURY PARK, NJ

No set details known. Two shows, 9:00pm and 1.00am, with Steve Van Zandt & Friends the lone act on the bill. The 'Friends' include Springsteen (just back from a Christmas trip to California), Garry Tallent, Danny Federici, Southside Johnny, Joe Hagstrom (guitar), and Bobby Williams (drums). An early attempt by Van Zandt to formulate new directions in the wake of Springsteen’s December 1970 decision to end Steel Mill.

1971-01-18 - D'SCENE, SOUTH AMBOY, NJ

HE'S GUILTY (THE JUDGE SONG) (10:43) / GOIN' BACK TO GEORGIA (8:27) / OH MAMA (4:18) / CHANGING CHILDREN (10:07) / MARY LOUISE WATSON (9:00) / DANCING IN THE STREET - HONKY TONK WOMEN (12:05) / I CAN'T TAKE IT NO MORE (7:56) / TRAIN RIDE (13:23) / I GOTTA BE FREE - TURN ON YOUR LOVELIGHT (12:00) / RESURRECTION (11:00) / RUN, SHAKER LIFE (10:39)

One show, double bill, with Steel Mill headlining with support from Godzilla. The above mentioned eleven-song setlist is believed to be the complete show and the entire performance is circulating in very good to excellent soundboard quality, although the material has a notorious history of being cannibalized, re-sequenced and incorrectly dated. Be aware that this show is sometimes listed as a twelve- or thirteen-song performance if "Honky Tonk Women" and/or "Turn On Your Lovelight" are counted as separate songs. "Mary Louise Watson" is also known by the title "Black Widow Spider". Last known performance of "I Can't Take It No More", which is also known by the title "I Can't Take It". "Changing Children" is also known as "Change It" or "Change It (Revolution)".

Some of this show is available on the CD 'Going Back In The Past' (Wild Bird) and 'All Those Years' (Templar) and parts are found on several other boots, sometimes with incorrect venue/date information. The performance was previously best obtained through private CDR sources that had the complete show with proper sequencing, but CDRs 'Right The F* On' (Palace) and 'Legend Of Steel Mill' (Vintage Masters) are sourced from lower generation tape compared to many sources and worth acquiring. Track running time info may vary widely depending on how between song 'dead time' is allocated.

1971-01-22 - THE UPSTAGE, ASBURY PARK, NJ

DANCING IN THE STREET - HONKY TONK WOMEN - PROUD MARY / OH MAMA / GOIN' BACK TO GEORGIA / HE'S GUILTY (THE JUDGE SONG) / CHANGING CHILDREN / TRAIN RIDE / I GOTTA BE FREE - TURN ON YOUR LOVELIGHT / RUN, SHAKER LIFE / RESURRECTION

One show, double bill, with Steel Mill headlining and National Debt opening. A pre-concert newspaper article in the Middletown Courier (see above) mentions two shows scheduled for this night, but none for the following evening. These two shows were ultimately 'split', with one show taking place on this and the following night. The above-mentioned nine-song setlist can be found on a good quality (for the era) audience recording that can be dated with a fairly high degree of confidence to this show, Steel Mill's penultimate. The 90-minute tape surfaced in early 2017 after a Springsteen fan took an Uber ride in New Jersey with the taper's brother. As often happens in Jersey, Springsteen came up in the conversation, and the driver said that his brother taped one of the final Steel Mill gigs at The Upstage on a cassette recorder, and he had CDs of the show in the car. Before long a deal was struck, and the discs were passed on to a long-time collector. Aside from the information from the taper's brother, there are several other compelling clues that lead us to place this information here. Firstly, the set includes "Train Ride", with Robbin Thompson providing the lead vocals, dating it to after August 1970. Towards the end of the show, the band gives a ninety-second PSA from the stage. They talk about how important the club is, that it's the only place where they can play and jam, and it needs to stay open. These comments can only be referring to The Upstage. Bruce also comments about Danny Federici's legal issues that arose from the incident at the Clearwater Swim Club in Atlantic Highlands in September 1970, and his subsequent guilty plea that took place sometime in November. Finally, Springsteen also mentions that the band is also playing tomorrow, and we know a show took place on January 23. The tape is the only piece of substantial audio of Springsteen performing at The Upstage known to exist, and captures Steel Mill in fine, spirited form, with some scorching guitar work from Springsteen throughout the set.

All nine songs found on the tape are essentially complete, aside from "Resurrection" which is cut at the end. There are fades between tracks, the opening bars of some are missing, and any between-song chat is also cut. Comparing the setlist to January 18 at D'Scene, they are very similar, therefore one or two songs could well be missing and the song order of either this set or January 18 is likely to be incorrect. The recording is not currently in circulation.

1971-01-23 - THE UPSTAGE, ASBURY PARK, NJ

SWEET MELINDA (4:20) / OH MAMA (4:37) / HE'S GUILTY (THE JUDGE SONG) (8:29)

One show, double bill, with Steel Mill headlining and National Debt opening. This was advertised as the final Steel Mill gig and current evidence supports this, including Springsteen noting this fact at D'Scene earlier in the week. The dissolution of Steel Mill was amicable. Apparently, Bruce had informed members in December, prior to a Christmas trip to California, of his desire to explore other musical directions. Speaking of his brief, five-month (September 1970 - January 1971) Steel Mill tenure, vocalist Robbin Thompson has commented: “it was a strange thing. No one really knew why I was in the band….but about half way through I knew the band, as it was, wasn’t going to last, especially me.”

The text below is copyrighted to Jeannie Clark Fisher. Jeannie played The Upstage the night after the show listed above.
"The Upstage Coffeehouse was a great place – small and intimate with a listening crowd. I remember climbing the stairway that led to the tiny backstage area. The stage itself was compact, but didn’t discourage the musicians on hand to jam at times on my solo sets – Bruce, Garry Tallent, Vini Lopez, Steve Van Zandt, “Southside” Johnny Lyon, and my good friend, the late clarinet/sax player, Terry Loughran. I sang and banged on the old, out-of -tune upright piano or strummed my Martin guitar, while Tinker taped the music onto his reel-to-reel recorder. (I still have the original tape of the show on January 24th. The band, “Odin”, with their lengthy, spacey, instrumental, acid-rock music, played that night, also.)"
Songs: “Feel Like A Woman”, “Back Here”, “Livin’ In The Country”, “You Ain’t Goin’ Nowhere”, “The World’s A Sad Place”, “Black Skies”, “No One’s Lesson But Your Own”.

The above-mentioned partial setlist is taken from a very good quality soundboard recording that is now in circulation. This material has yet to appear on any mainstream CD boot, but can be found on the CDR 'Legend Of Steel Mill' (Vintage Masters). The audio features continuity between songs and marks the first ever appearance of any Springsteen audio from The Upstage. These three songs are culled from early in the set and may possibly be the show’s opening three numbers. This is also the first time a rendition of “Sweet Melinda” has surfaced in nice sound quality. The remainder of the show has not surfaced.

1971-01-29 - THE UPSTAGE, ASBURY PARK, NJ

JAM IMPROVISATION #1 (15:20) / JAM IMPROVISATION #2 (11:25)

Two shows, 9:00pm and 1.00am, with Steve Van Zandt & The Big Bad Bobby Williams Band the lone act on the bill. Springsteen is believed to have made a guest appearance during parts of one or both of these shows. The Big Bad Bobby Williams Band was a fairly short-lived group (November 1970 - March 1971) and consisted of Bobby Williams (drums, vocals), Garry Tallent (bass), Steve Van Zandt (vocals, guitar), David Sancious (organ) and Southside Johnny (harp, vocals).

The above-noted setlist is culled from nearly 27 minutes of very good quality soundboard audio. The exact date of the recording is not yet known, although it’s from this close-proximity time period. The audio is likely to be from either this January 29 Upstage gig or from a show the band performed at the Sunshine In on February 19. This audio represents only a small part of an entire show and the musicians heard on this segment of audio are Van Zandt-Tallent-Sancious-Williams. Southside is not heard and neither is Springsteen (who didn’t play on February 19th). Van Zandt handles the vocals on both songs and his lead and slide guitar work here is phenomenal, the best representation of Van Zandt’s guitar prowess available on any known audio.

1971-03-18 - DEAL PARK RECREATION CENTER, DEAL, NJ

No set details known. One show, double bill, with Springsteen headlining and country-rock band Highway opening. This was a Jewish Community sponsored dance orchestrated by the Young Hebrew Association (YWHA), who utilized the park facility as its clubhouse. Although the poster billing "Bruce Springsteen" implies a possible solo performance, it wasn’t. The billing reflects the fact that Bruce had no settled band (or band name) at this point. Springsteen utilized a four-piece backing band for this show and according to the most reliable recollections its line-up consisted of Steve Van Zandt, Vini Lopez, Garry Tallent, and David Sancious.

Apparently the entire show (including Highway) was audience audio recorded by the head Rabbi... then accidentally erased soon afterward!
00Photo-32.png

1971-03-27 - SUNSHINE IN, ASBURY PARK, NJ

Two shows, 7:30pm and 10:30pm, triple bill, with Springsteen (under the unique moniker of Bruce Springsteen & Friendly Enemies) opening for the second-billed Cowboy and headliner The Allman Brothers Band. Bruce and Steve Van Zandt were major Allman Brothers fans and during February Bruce lobbied hard to be part of the show, despite the fact that Steel Mill had broken up and Bruce had not yet settled on a new band. Ultimately Bruce decided to utilize the extended clan of musicians he’d been jamming with at The Upstage during preceding weeks and this event is perhaps the ultimate example of Asbury Park performing legend.

The billing name "Friendly Enemies" was chosen during February. It was actually a week or two prior to this March 27 gig that the famous moniker Dr Zoom & The Sonic Boom was conjured up, but it was too late to change the name on the promotional material and posters for the show. Indeed, much of the long-standing discrepancy about how many Dr Zoom gigs were performed stems from the fact that some people count this night’s two shows as Dr Zoom gigs, others don’t count them. The two shows on this night weren’t billed under the name 'Dr Zoom', but they included all the elements of the 2 later Dr Zoom shows in May, in fact they included more musicians and props than the either of the two later 'official' Zoom shows.

Springsteen’s backing band for this gig (the so-called "Friendly Enemies") consisted of Steve Van Zandt (guitar), Garry Tallent (bass), David Sancious (keyboards), Vini Lopez (drums, vocals), Southside Johnny (harp, vocals), Albee Tellone (sax, vocals), former Rogues member John "Hotkeys" Waasdorp (electric piano), Bobby Feigenbaum (tenor sax), Bobby Williams (drums, vocals), and Tinker West (congas). Danny Federici was not present at this show. There was also a chorus/skit troupe of Upstage regulars nicknamed "The Sonic People'" that included Connie Manser (the baton twirler), Robin Nash, Jeannie Clark, Fifi Longo, and Kevin Kavanaugh topped off by a quartet (Kevin "Bird" Connair, Bruce Greenwood, Big Danny Gallagher and Upstage bouncer Roger "Black Tiny" Lewis) that sat on stage playing the game Monopoly during Bruce’s performance. At one point during the show Springsteen sat at the Monopoly table while singing. The Monopoly game and the baton twirling were unique to this show, these antics were not incorporated into any later shows. The name "Sonic People" later became known as "The Zoomettes".

Apparently, The Allman Brothers got a kick out of Bruce’s combination of zany props and inspired music. Backstage between shows Duane Allman gave some slide guitar tips to Steve Van Zandt and also played some impromptu slide on top of a soundboard tape listening session of Bruce’s early show that Tinker West was conducting. Allman was quoted as saying "that's one cookin' band, man". Sadly this would turn out to be the only Sunshine In appearance for The Allman Brothers Band. Although tentatively booked for a November 1971 return engagement (see August 7 listing) the death of Duane Allman in a motorcycle crash on October 31 caused the group to cancel.

1971-05-14 - SUNSHINE IN, ASBURY PARK, NJ

IT TAKES A LOT TO LAUGH, IT TAKES A TRAIN TO CRY / GOIN’ BACK TO GEORGIA / SIX DAYS ON THE ROAD / JAMBALAYA (ROLL OVER) / CRY TO ME / FAST BLUES SHUFFLE / ZOOM THEME / SLOW BLUES / ONE MORE TRY / ROLL OVER BEETHOVEN – REELIN’ AND ROCKIN’

One show, triple bill. This is the first of only two performances ever of Dr Zoom & The Sonic Boom (the other show was outdoors the following day). Undercard acts for this debut show were Sunny Jim and Godzilla (who were a late substitution for Cornerstone). In reality, Dr Zoom was merely a progression of Springsteen’s March 1971 "Friendly Enemies" shows at The Sunshine In and his April 1971 "Jam Concerts" at The Upstage. Much of the long-standing confusion about how many Dr Zoom shows were performed stems from the fact that some people count the above-mentioned March-April gigs as Dr Zoom events, while others don’t count them. Technically speaking they weren’t Dr Zoom shows, but they did contain most of the musicians and the same party-like atmosphere.

The members of Dr Zoom & The Sonic Boom were Springsteen, Steve Van Zandt (guitar), David Sancious (keyboards), Garry Tallent (bass), Vini Lopez (drums and backing vocals), Southside Johnny (harmonica and vocals), Bobby Williams (drums), Albee 'Albany Al' Tellone (tenor saxophone), and Bobby Feigenbaum (alto saxophone). There was also an eight-member backing vocal troupe nicknamed "The Zoomettes", consisting of Jeannie Clark, Robin Nash, Connie Manser, Fifi Longo, Sherl Tallent, Kevin Kavanaugh, Steve Large, and John Luraschi. The MC was Kevin "Bird" Connair. Big Danny Gallagher handled the on-stage props. Danny Federici was not involved in the Dr Zoom shows.

The ten-song setlist noted above has been culled from a document (in Bruce’s handwriting) that is probably the song schedule for this debut Dr Zoom gig. The material is clearly identifiable by Bruce’s header of 'Sonic Tunes'. Whether or not Bruce made any late changes to this setlist for the actual performance is not known. Written on the setlist as "Dave Dudley", the third song is actually "Six Days On The Road", the 1963 hit made famous by country music singer Dave Dudley. The song is a celebration of the American trucker and was covered regularly on the Jersey-shore in the 1970s by many bands, including Albee Tellone's Hired Hands. "Fast Blues Shuffle" may be Bruce’s name for "Last Night In Texas" (as also performed at the following day’s Zoom gig). "Zoom Theme" is a rewrite of Irving Berlin's "Alexander's Ragtime Band".

The text below is copyrighted to Jeannie Clark Fisher.
Sunshine In, Asbury Park, NJ, 05-14-71; Newark State College, Newark, NJ, 05-15-71
"I was a “Zoomette” for two gigs with “Dr. Zoom and the Sonic Boom”, Bruce’s interim band. It was a fun and joyous, somewhat organized, free-for-all! My memory of the Sunshine Inn was a large, rectangular room with concrete floors and square support pillars and a free-standing stage to one side. There was standing room only and lots of people dancing. The next day we went out to Newark for an outside performance. I still have the short, butterfly, hippie dress I wore that day and I bring it out occasionally for Gross National Product, my high school band, reunion concerts."

There is no audio of this Dr Zoom show. Collectors should note that the widely circulating boot CD 'The Bruce Springsteen Story, Vol 5' (E Street Records) mistakenly lists that audio as being from this Sunshine In gig. However the audio is actually from the following day’s outdoor Dr Zoom performance at Newark State College (see May 15 listing for details).

(11.23) / JAMBALAYA (ROLL OVER) (8.23) / ZOOM THEME (2.29) / LADY OF BOSTON - ONE MORE TRY (12.35)

The second (and final) performance of Dr Zoom & The Sonic Boom at the first annual "Ernie the Chickin' Festival", an excuse for an all-day, outdoor party extravaganza featuring several local bands including Sunny Jim and Odin.

The show opens with the Bob Dylan penned "It Takes A Lot To Laugh, It Takes A Train To Cry", sometimes incorrectly labelled "Group Therapy". Steve Van Zandt can be heard jokingly warning the campus ambulances (who were parked nearby) to get ready as Bruce opens the show with some screeching guitar! It was long thought that this statement was made by Kevin "Bird" Connair but Albee Tellone has confirmed that Connair was not at this show. "Last Night In Texas" is a rewrite of Sonny Boy Williamson II's "One Way Out"; "Zoom Theme" is a rewrite of Irving Berlin's "Alexander's Ragtime Band". "Lady Of Boston" includes an interpolated section of The Rolling Stones' "One More Try".

A very good quality soundboard tape of most (possibly all) of the Dr Zoom set can be found on the CD boot 'The Bruce Springsteen Story, Vol 5: Dr Zoom & The Sonic Boom' (E Street Records). The liner notes of the bootleg incorrectly lists the audio as emanating from the previous night’s performance at The Sunshine In, however this audio is definitely from the outdoor (not indoor) Dr Zoom show.

Tinker set up a solo concert for me in the summer of 1971. I don't remember the exact date. The outdoor concert was in a park not far from the ocean and the Long Branch boardwalk. I remember seeing Bruce in the audience, appearing very interested as I sang my song 'It Really Doesn't Matter'. After I finished Bruce jumped up on stage, followed by Vini Lopez, Garry Tallent and the usual crowd of New Jersey musicians, to jam the rest of the night away.

This was Springsteen’s last gig as a core member of The Sundance Blues Band, although he would continue to make guest appearances right up until the band was mothballed in early 1972. David Sancious (keyboards) was later added to the line-up in place of Springsteen.

1971-07-10 - BROOKDALE COMMUNITY COLLEGE, LINCROFT, NJ

C.C. RIDER - DOWN THE ROAD APIECE (10:31) / YOU MEAN SO MUCH TO ME (5:20) / COME ON BILLY (BREAK OUT THE WINE) (4:42) / LAST NIGHT IN TULSA (4:30) / GOIN’ BACK TO GEORGIA (7:55) / NATURAL MAGIC (end cut, 2:25) / DARKNESS, DARKNESS (17:25) / DANCE DANCE DANCE (6:14) / JAMBALAYA (ROLL OVER) (6:39)

One show, quadruple billing, with the newly-formed Bruce Springsteen Band headlining the outdoor '2nd Annual Nothing’s Festival'. Undercard acts were Sunny Jim, Odin and Jeannie Clark. This gig is the first known performance of The Bruce Springsteen Band. They’re essentially a modified version of Dr Zoom & The Sonic Boom (minus The Zoomettes, Southside Johnny and the various vaudeville elements). The line-up of this initial version is Springsteen, Van Zandt, Sancious, Tallent and Lopez plus (on selected tracks) Bobby Feigenbaum (sax), Harvey Cherlin (trumpet), along with the vocal duet of Delores Holmes and Barbara Dinkins. This large nine-member lineup of the band will eventually expand to ten, with the addition of Bruce’s manager Tinker West on congas. However this 'big band sound' will only last about two months before it begins to shrink.

"This was the second annual “Nothing’s Festival”, although the first annual one, scheduled at the Beachcomber in Long Branch, NJ, didn’t happen for some reason. A brainchild of Carl “Tinker” West, the event was truly in the flower-people spirit; nobody got paid and no one paid to come. It was a warm, summer afternoon. My father tuned the piano and he also tuned for Bruce on several other occasions. Bruce Springsteen’s Band was the headliner. I did my solo set and bands, Sunny Jim and Odin filled in the middle spots. My friend, Geoff, said to me as Bruce was playing, “this guy is going to be really big someday”."
My songs: “You Ain’t Goin’ Nowhere” (Bob Dylan cover), “Back Here”, “Feel Like A Woman”.

The above-mentioned setlist is taken from a 66-minute outdoor audience recording of (at best) fair quality. Given this show was a four-artist billing this audio is likely to represent most (possibly all) of Bruce’s performance at this show. This above-mentioned audio (minus "Natural Magic" and "Jambalaya") can be found on the CD boot 'Down The Road Apiece' (Golden Stars). These performances of "Natural Magic" and "Jambalaya" are not currently found on any mainstream boot. Collectors should note that the liner notes on the 'Down The Road Apiece' bootleg mistakenly credits this audio to a December 17 indoor club performance at Rutgers. This tape is also available as a cassette transfer by Mjk5510 which does include both Natural Magic and Jambalaya.

1971-07-11 - SUNSHINE IN, ASBURY PARK, NJ

Set list is undocumented. The Bruce Springsteen Band opens for the (at the time) red-hot Humble Pie. After the show, an impressed Peter Frampton, leader of Humble Pie, tells Springsteen and the band he'd like to have them open for them on a national basis. Frampton also states that he would be happy to get the band an audition with his record label, the prestigious A&M Records. For no logical reason manager, Tinker West declines both offers on the spot. The story is corroborated in separate published interviews with Peter Frampton and Bruce Springsteen Band trumpet player Harvey Cherlin. The show was reviewed in very favourable terms in the Asbury Park Press of July 12, 1971. The ten-strong Bruce Springsteen Band for this show consisted of core members Springsteen, Van Zandt, Tallent, Lopez and Sancious, plus (on selected songs) Harvey Cherlin (trumpet), Bobby Feigenbaum (sax), Delores Holmes (vocals), Barbara Dinkins (vocals) and Tinker West (congas).

1971-07-18 - MONROE PARK, RICHMOND, VA

No set details known. One daytime outdoor show, with the 10 piece Bruce Springsteen Band headlining. Support act was Sunny Jim. This was the first known gig a Springsteen-led band had played in Monroe Park since his Richmond debut (with Child - see June 1, 1969 listing). Apparently, after their show, some of the band and its entourage went to see an outdoor concert by The Byrds somewhere in the general vicinity (possibly the State Fairgrounds in Richmond).

1971-07-22 - D'SCENE, SOUTH AMBOY, NJ

List #1: COME ON BILLY (BREAK OUT THE WINE) / YOU MEAN SO MUCH TO ME / Instrumental / SOMETIMES AT NIGHT / NATURAL MAGIC / BORDER GUARD / LAST NIGHT IN TULSA / I HOPE I’M TRUE / IF YOU WANT TO GET HIGH / I’M A BIG GIRL NOW

List #2: CHEROKEE QUEEN / SHE’S GOT THE LORD / YOU DON’T LEAVE ME NO CHOICE / IT’S ALL RIGHT / DO IT WITH A FEELING / SPANISH DREAMS / JAMBALAYA (ROLL OVER) / GYPSY RIDER / FULL OF LOVE / DANCE DANCE DANCE / SO MUCH STYLE / FAST BLUES

Two shows, 9.00pm and 11.30pm, double bill, with The Bruce Springsteen Band (in its 9-10 member incarnation) headlining and Sunny Jim opening. This was the first of two consecutive Thursday evening appearances at the club. There is no known audio of either show. A song list in Springsteen's handwriting (click the above date/location link to view) has been recalled with some degree of confidence by one of the band members as emanating from either this night or the following week's booking at this club. This does not appear to be not a setlist, but many (or possibly all) of the songs must have been performed at the July 22 and 29 shows. These are all Springsteen compositions and there are several rarities here of which no circulating audio has yet emerged from any show, rehearsal or studio source, such as "I Hope I'm True", "If You Want To Get High", and "I'm A Big Girl Now". A recently discovered soundboard recording from one of the shows on July 29 includes one of these previously unknown songs, "Full Of Love". The song written only as "Instrumental" may be what is generally referred to as "Darkness, Darkness", which was regularly played by the Bruce Springsteen Band around this time. In addition, a sheet containing handwritten lyrics of "Sometimes At Night" has been displayed at Hard Rock Cafe in Brussels, which can also be viewed by click on the date/location link above. "Come On Billy (Break Out The Wine)" is also known by the titles "Nothing Can Stop Me" or "Nothing Can Stop Me Now".

1971-07-23 - GUGGENHEIM BANDSHELL, DAMROSCH PARK, LINCOLN CENTER, NEW YORK CITY, NY

C.C. RIDER - DOWN THE ROAD APIECE (10:00) / YOU MEAN SO MUCH TO ME (5:07) / COME ON BILLY (BREAK OUT THE WINE) (5:15) / I’M IN LOVE AGAIN (4:11) / DANCE DANCE DANCE (5:52) / YOU DON’T LEAVE ME NO CHOICE (8:55) / JAMBALAYA (ROLL OVER) (12:47)

One show, with The Bruce Springsteen Band (along with several other unsigned groups) performing as part of the Guggenheim Memorial Concert Series that took place daily in Damrosch Park during the summer of 1971. According to the New York Times the headliner and scheduled 8.00pm show closer on July 23 was The Richard Goldman Band, a classical orchestra noted for its creative use of wind and brass instruments. Bruce and his team were one of several unnamed-in-print undercard acts, each of who were allocated hour-long performing slots. At one point Bruce can be heard off mike asking “How much more time do we have?” The response back is “fifteen minutes” and Bruce times the end of his show impeccably. The fact that Bruce’s mid-1971 lineup included horns may have been the reason Tinker got this particular booking. The trumpet and sax are highly prevalent throughout and the arrangements (likely created by Van Zandt) are outstanding.

Although this was an outdoor event, Bruce and the band were performing within the Guggenheim Band Shell. The superb acoustics of that shell, combined with an un-degraded source tape, have resulted in a truly exceptional concert document. Add to this a tight, highly disciplined and inspired performance by the entire band and it’s easy to see why most rate this Damrosch gig as the finest pre-CBS Springsteen concert currently in existence. This texture of this performance is more in keeping with the funkiness of Bruce’s 1974 Wild & Innocent Tour dates and early Asbury Jukes shows. It is essential audio in any Springsteen collection.

The nine-member Bruce Springsteen Band at Damrosch Park is the same as the ten-member contingent that performed at The Sunshine In ten days earlier (see July 11 listing) with the exception that Tinker West is not playing congas, it seems Tinker was busy working the soundboard. This show includes some of Bruce’s finest early-period songwriting efforts. There are definitive live performances of “Jambalaya” and “You Mean So Much To Me” Delores Holmes delivers the sexy Ronnie Spector-ish lead vocal on "I'm In Love Again" and "You Don't Leave Me No Choice". A Springsteen lead vocal of these two songs has yet to surface. Bruce’s searing guitar work during “You Don’t Leave Me No Choice” is among his all-time best.

Extensive research has revealed little; the Bruce Springsteen Band was not mentioned in the program or the New York Times. Many thanks to Special Collections in Performing Arts at the University of Maryland.

The above-mentioned setlist is taken from a soundboard recording that is available on the CD 'The Bruce Springsteen Story, Vol 6' (E Street Records). The bootleg cover implies some Columbia Records/CBS affiliation with the recording but this is just fantasy artwork. This 60-minute recording has continuity between songs and is almost certainly the complete show from this afternoon gig.

1971-07-25 - MONMOUTH HILLS CLUBHOUSE, RUMSON, NJ

No set details known. This must rank as one of the strangest shows played by the Bruce Springsteen Band. Along with Mel Arnold's Orchestra they are hired to entertain guests at the 'going public' of the Marine International Corporation, a company engaged in the catching, processing and distributing of various marine resources. A company of VIP guests, including Senator Richard R. Stout, were fed the finest of seafood to the strains of the orchestra. The Bruce Springsteen Band took the stage at 1.00am.

1971-07-29 - D'SCENE, SOUTH AMBOY, NJ

C.C. RIDER (11:44) / YOU MEAN SO MUCH TO ME (5:23) / COME ON BILLY (BREAK OUT THE WINE) (5:40) / NATURAL MAGIC (6:06) / FULL OF LOVE (5:43) / DARKNESS, DARKNESS (18:29) / GOIN' BACK TO GEORGIA (9:19) / I'M IN LOVE AGAIN (4:23) / DANCE DANCE DANCE (6:57) / LAST NIGHT IN TULSA (5:21) / YOU DON'T LEAVE ME NO CHOICE (7:33) / JAMBALAYA (ROLL OVER) (12:05)

Two shows (9.00pm and 11:30pm), double bill, with the nine-piece Bruce Springsteen Band headlining and Sunny Jim opening. The Band consists of core members Springsteen, Van Zandt, Tallent, Lopez, and Sancious, plus (on selected songs) Harvey Cherlin (trumpet), Bobby Feigenbaum (saxophone), Delores Holmes (vocals), and Barbara Dinkins (vocals).

The above twelve-song setlist is from an excellent quality soundboard recording that is not currently in circulation. This source is unique in being the only known recording of a complete, full-length Bruce Springsteen Band concert with backing singers and horns. The reels were recently discovered in the vault of a highly respected collector and originally belonged to Mike Appel. Three songs from this recording ("You Mean So Much To Me", "Come On Billy (Break Out The Wine)", and "Natural Magic") can be found on the CD 'The Bruce Springsteen Story, Vol 4' (E Street Records), incorrectly attributed to a show the following week at Sunshine In in Asbury Park. During the show, Bruce (and Vini Lopez, who calls the club the Sunshine Out) can be heard advertising their upcoming appearance. The sound quality of the new source is a substantial upgrade over the three songs found on the aforementioned bootleg, about 114-minutes long with continuity between songs, and certainly the complete set. There were two shows tonight, it is uncertain which the recording emanates from.

Unsurprisingly, the set structure is similar to the show a week earlier at Damrosch Park in New York City, opening with "C.C Rider" before "You Mean So Much To Me", which interestingly Bruce introduces with the title "When She Sings To Me". "Natural Magic" was, at the time, probably Bruce's finest love song. This is the only known recording of "Full Of Love", a song that was previously known from a handwritten setlist document which is believed to emanate from a gig at this venue. While the chorus is actually sung "I thank the Lord above / for sending me a woman that is filled with so much love", it seems highly likely that they are the same song. The instrumental "Darkness, Darkness" clocks in at over 18 minutes, and contains elements that would later be found in "Kitty's Back". Delores Holmes provides the vocals on "I'm In Love Again" and "You Don't Leave Me No Choice", which once again features some outstanding guitar work from Springsteen.

1971-08-07 - SUNSHINE IN, ASBURY PARK, NJ

One show, double bill, with The Bruce Springsteen Band headlining with a 90-minute performance and Psychotic Blues Band opening with a 60-minute performance. The Bruce Springsteen Band at this show features the same nine-piece lineup that played at Damrosch Park two weeks earlier.

A suite of three soundboard recordings ("You Mean So Much To Me", "Come On Billy (Break Out The Wine)" aka "Nothing Can Stop Me", and "Natural Magic") found on the CD 'The Bruce Springsteen Story, Vol 4' (E Street Records) are attributed to this date but are in fact from July 29 at D'Scene in South Amboy, NJ, the previous week. See that listing for more information. A fourth soundboard recording found on this CD, “Hoochie Coochie Man”, is a performance by the Psychotic Blues Band and may actually be from this show, but that is uncertain.

1971-09-01 - GARFIELD PARK, LONG BRANCH, NJ

LITTLE QUEENIE / BRIGHT LIGHTS, BIG CITY / THE BALLAD OF JESSE JAMES / JUMPIN’ JACK FLASH - IT’S TIME TO GO HOME / I’VE GOT TO HAVE YOU BABY / YOU BETTER BE NICE TO ME, BABY / (GET YOUR KICKS ON) ROUTE 66 / THE NIGHT THEY DROVE OLD DIXIE DOWN / DANCE DANCE DANCE (with Tinker West) / JAMBALAYA (ROLL OVER) (with Tinker West et al.)

One show, triple bill, with the five-member Bruce Springsteen Band headlining. The support acts for this show were originally Sweet Chariot and Tumbleweed, but it appears that the latter were replaced at the last minute by The Joe Hagstrom Squeak Band. This was an outdoor show orchestrated by Tinker West’s Blah Productions. Garfield Park is located at the intersection of Broadway and Ocean Ave, near the ocean. The above-mentioned ten-song, partial setlist is culled from a 66-minute audience recording of this show, none of which has ever appeared on any mainstream boot and all of which remains in very limited circulation. Unfortunately, the taper utilized a cheap recording device. The sound quality is consistent but is weak (fair), although it’s not horrible. While the opening seconds of “Little Queenie” are missing, all other songs are complete. However this performance apparently lasted nearly two hours, so there’s quite a bit missing and discernible edits can be heard in between songs on the audio source.

The line-up for this show is Springsteen, Van Zandt, Sancious, Tallent and Lopez. Although Bruce handles all the lead vocals, the performance is unusual in that Springsteen is on piano for most of these ten songs from this show. Sancious plays the organ and Steve Van Zandt handles much of the guitar chores. Tinker West guests on congas on “Dance Dance Dance” and the rousing finale “Jambalaya” (which also features an unidentified walk-on troupe of backing vocalists consisting of inner circle troops and members of both undercard bands). Highlights of this show are “The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down” (the only known Springsteen performance), as well as the only known audio of two Springsteen compositions, “It’s Time To Go Home” (also known by the title “Festival”) and “You Better Be Nice To Me, Baby”. "The Ballad Of Jesse James" is also known by the title "Don't You Want To Be An Outlaw".

1971-09-03 - STUDENT PRINCE, ASBURY PARK, NJ

No set details known. One show, 9:30pm to 1.00am, with The Bruce Springsteen Band the sole act on the bill. Evidence strongly points to this night as being the start of what would turn out to be a virtual 3½ month residency at the club, encompassing nearly 40 shows.

September would also mark the beginning of the end of the ten-member 'big band' lineup of the band that Springsteen had been utilizing since July. Due to financial constraints, the non-core members of the Bruce Springsteen Band (Dinkins-Holmes-Cherlin-Feigenbaum-West-Daniels) will only appear, either in whole or in part, at a handful of special occasion gigs during the remainder of 1971.

At a July 29, 1978 concert in St. Petersburg, FL, Bruce mentions that the band used to play Chuck Berry's "Around And Around" at the Student Prince. It's likely he was referring to this residency, although how frequent and at which shows, we can't tell.

1971-09-04 - STUDENT PRINCE, ASBURY PARK, NJ

One show 9:30pm to 1.00am, with The Bruce Springsteen Band the sole act on the bill. A typical Bruce Springsteen Band gig at this club consisted of four 40 minute sets separated by healthy intermissions (2½ hrs total playing time). As fate would have it, Norman Seldin & The Joyful Noyze (featuring its then-new member Clarence Clemons) was in the final stages of a 7 week (July 16 - September 5) residency at the nearby Wonder Bar. By comparing the common denominator times in both bands performing schedules it can be deduced that it was most likely on this night (or the night before) that Clarence Clemons walked over to the Student Prince during a Wonder Bar intermission and first met (and jammed with) Springsteen. Contrary to widespread belief (and Bruce and Clarence’s wonderful, but 'embellished', stories of the meeting) Clemons did not quickly resign from Seldin’s band and join Bruce, he remained a fixture in The Joyful Noyze until October 1972.

One show, triple bill, with The Bruce Springsteen Band headlining. Trumpet player Harvey Cherlin and backup singers Barbara Dinkins and Delores Holmes are not featured. They are absent. The band is comprised of only the five core members; Springsteen, Van Zandt, Tallent, Sancious and Lopez. Undercards were the New Jersey-based outfits Tumbleweed and Black Forrest Rhodes, both had recently become involved with Tinker West’s Blah Productions. The three-member, acoustic-orientated Tumbleweed deserves special mention. They had recently returned from studio sessions in Nashville (booked under the name Montana Flintlock), events orchestrated by Mike Appel. Tumbleweed would turn out to be the original connection between Tinker West and Appel, one that would soon have Tinker driving Springsteen to New York to meet Mike.

The majority of the audio listed above was previously listed under the date, March 17, 1972, at Richmond Arena, Richmond, VA. However, the discovery of two reels in the collection of a highly respected collector has led us to move the audio to this date. The reels have excellent pedigree, originally belonging to Mike Appel, and are marked with this date and location.

The discovery of these reels is significant for a number of reasons. First, it includes the complete (aside from small edits due to tape changes) twelve-song, 127-minute show in the correct order, including two songs not found in the previously circulating audio. The sound quality is a significant upgrade over the old tapes, with distinctive improvements in clarity, separation, and a lack of background noise and hiss. The first additional song, the blues-standard "Key To The Highway", is known from a subsequent performance at the Student Prince in December, but the audio quality here is a vast improvement over the fair-quality audience recording from that show. However, it's the discovery of the second new song that is most important, a previously unknown Springsteen composition, the set closing "Don't Look Back", introduced by Bruce with that title (unrelated to the outtake from Darkness On The Edge Of Town). It is a slow, dirge-like song led by Springsteen on the piano and is nearly eleven minutes long. It is extremely reminiscent of some of the solo material that he would go on to record in the spring of 1972. "Don't Look Back" is about a struggling, previously successful singer and perhaps could be autobiographical, at least in part. Part of the final verse reads:

They'll take you, they'll make you and break you until you're almost gone / And they'll throw you to the street hounds to pick your bones / Till you're so damned stoned and confused and you can't sing nothing but the blues / You're just another winner whose turn it was to lose / Now them days for you are over and you're lucky to have survived / Here you go again with another rock n roll band, just playing to keep yourself breathing

Audio recordings from this show have been in circulation with collectors since the early 1980s, although they tended to circulate in bits and pieces and were incorrectly dated. For many years this tape was incorrectly attributed to a November 1970 Steel Mill gig in Richmond. However this is clearly not Steel Mill, as Robbin Thompson is not present, Springsteen and Van Zandt share lead guitar duties and David Sancious is on keyboards. Springsteen plays piano on both “Cherokee Queen” and “Look Toward The Land” (with Sancious handling organ). Only “Cherokee Queen” has appeared on any mainstream bootleg since it was pressed on acetate as a Sioux City publishing demo later in 1972. In 2007, a veteran collector discovered an old tape long overlooked in his collection that contained a previously undocumented, additional song from this show (the Springsteen composition “Coming Home”) which is one of the performance highlights. Shortly thereafter that same collector released the contents of his tapes as the 'Non Über Project Volume One', which is ten songs and ninety-five minutes long.

For the very first time, this release presented the music in stereo even "Cherokee Queen", which was originally pressed on acetate in mono. However, the songs were still in the incorrect order of appearance. Like all previous releases, it had the wrong date and venue, March 17, 1972 at the Richmond Arena, Richmond, VA. The incomplete show is also available on CDR 'Fantastic Virginia' the Vintage Masters label. Unfortunately the opening and closing couple of minutes of “When You Dance” are cut on all currently circulating tapes, however, both are intact on the newly discovered reels. For the first encore, voices can be heard near the front of the stage yelling for “Resurrection” (a song Bruce stopped playing when Steel Mill folded). Bruce doesn't oblige, but instead delivers “Goin’ Back To Georgia”, itself rarely played by the Bruce Springsteen Band. Bruce performs a condensed arrangement, without any band harmony vocals.

Francine Daniels likely made her debut with the band (replacing Barbara Dinkins) at this show or at St. Jerome School earlier in the evening. This was the second to last night The Upstage was open - the club closed for good on October 30. There was a similar jam session show on the final night, however, Bruce and his band did not attend because they were performing a gig in Richmond.

1971-10-30 - VCU NEW GYM, VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY, RICHMOND, VA

MC’s introduction / GOT MY MOJO WORKING / LIVING ROCK AND ROLL / TALKIN’ ABOUT MY BABY / HOOCHIE COOCHIE MAN / THE BALLAD OF JESSE JAMES

One show, triple bill, with The Bruce Springsteen Band supporting headliner Cactus. The Paul Butterfield Blues Band was originally scheduled to headline with Cactus second billed. However, Butterfield cancelled a couple of weeks beforehand and Springsteen was substituted. Though not mentioned on the gig poster (above), also on the bill and opening the show with a 45-minute performance was local band Morning Son (John Mulkins, David Waddle and Steve Knopp). Audio evidence suggests the Bruce Springsteen Band lineup for this show was the core five-piece band, plus the vocal duo of Delores Holmes and Francine Daniels (who’d recently replaced vocalist Barbara Dinkins). Bruce would later utilize the melody from “Talkin’ About My Baby” for his far superior 1972 composition “Janey Needs A Shooter”. The ladies are heard on the three Springsteen compositions but not the two cover songs.

The above-mentioned setlist is taken from an audience recording of only fair quality that started circulating in the early 80s and then widely propagated after it was booted on the LP 'BRUCE 1971'. The original boot correctly identified the audio source venue as the VCU Gym. However, because no 1971 VCU gig had been identified by 1980s concert history sources, some people began linking this audio to other shows. This forty minutes of audio (which is only about half the total performance) now circulates via homemade CDR, sometimes with material from other shows.

1971-10-31 - NATIONAL GUARD ARMORY, LONG BRANCH, NJ

No set details known. One triple bill Halloween show, with The Bruce Springsteen Band headlining. Support bands were Tumbleweed and Black Forrest Rhodes. This is believed to be the final show to features Delores Holmes, Francine Daniels, and Bobby Feigenbaum, effectively ending the "big band" period for The Bruce Springsteen Band.

1971-11-04 - POCKETFUL OF TUNES INC, NEW YORK CITY, NY

BABY DOLL

Bruce's first-ever meeting with future manager Mike Appel, held at Wes Farrel's publishing company, where Appel was employed. Tinker West, who knew Appel through the group Tumbleweed (aka Montana Flintlock), organized the get-together and drove Bruce to New York City for the meeting. Bruce performed 2, 3 or 4 songs (accounts differ), some on piano, some on acoustic guitar. Only Appel and West were present at this first meeting. Appel has stated in interview that he was not particularly impressed by what he heard at this initial audition but did see raw creativity in the lyrics of "Baby Doll". The titles of the other songs performed are unclear. The meeting ended with an agreement to keep in touch but no commitments from either party. The next Springsteen-Appel meeting, in March 1972 (see listing), would elicit a dramatically more enthusiastic response from Appel.

No circulating audio.

1971-11-12 - STUDENT PRINCE, ASBURY PARK, NJ

One show, with The Bruce Springsteen Band the sole act on the bill.

The above-mentioned partial setlist is taken from a long-circulating, muddy soundboard recording which can be found on the CDR 'Legend Of Steel Mill' (Vintage Masters). Comments made by Bruce regarding video footage being shot during the show positively link this audio to The Student Prince. Prior to beginning “I Remember” Springsteen can be heard informing the audience that a gentleman named Mark Romanski is present and filming. Romanski, a friend of Steve Van Zandt, was filming as part of a course project he was taking at University. Sadly all the film footage was destroyed in the early 1970s. It is believed this filming was undertaken at one of the November 1971 shows, although the specific date has not been determined. The first five songs exhibit continuity and are clearly part of the same set. “When You Dance” is from this show but it seems to be the final song of the evening. "Bless My Soul" is also known by the title "You Sure Can Dance". Southside Johnny is a guest and handles the lead vocal on “Ain’t That Peculiar”. Southside’s harp playing can be heard on all the songs except for “When You Dance”. “I Remember” is cut prematurely.

One show, 9:30pm to 1.00am, with The Bruce Springsteen Band the sole act on the bill. A typical Bruce Springsteen Band gig at this club consisted of four 40-minute sets separated by healthy intermissions (2½ hrs total playing time). An 'unravel-the-Springsteen-song-titles' table mat puzzle (shown above) was produced by the club for use during this month-long residency. The eleven songs titles mentioned are "Cowboys Of The Sea", "Down To Mexico", "Just Can't Change", "I Remember", "Like A Stranger", "Magic Loving", "Maria", "No Way", "Make Your Mind Up", "When You Dance" and "Funk Song" (more commonly known to fans by the title "The Band's Just Boppin' The Blues" or "Secret To The Blues"). Interestingly these eleven songs range from Steel Mill-era creations ("Just Can't Change") to recently written material showcasing Springsteen's rapidly developing lyric skills ("Cowboys Of The Sea").

Two of these songs ("Maria" and "No Way") are not known from any circulating audio.

One four hour show. Bruce makes an unadvertised guest appearance at this quadruple billing concert featuring local groups The Rich Baron Band, Taylors Mills Road, Tumbleweed and Psychotic Blues Band. Bruce had been invited to the gig by Pat Karwin, the lead guitarist of Tumbleweed and participates (on lead guitar) in a 30-minute end-of-show 'jam' that included a line-up of Springsteen, Karwin, and members of Psychotic Blues Band.

SWEET MISS SALLY (9:15) / SHE’S LEAVING (9:38) / KEY TO THE HIGHWAY (6:54) / SURE CAN FEEL THE PAIN (14:09)

One show with The Bruce Springsteen Band the lone act on the bill. A typical performance at The Student Prince consisted of three or four 40-minute sets with healthy breaks in between. From a historical standpoint, the key tracks are “She’s Leaving” (later recorded as a solo demo - here it’s performed with the band) and the excellent “Sure Can Feel The Pain”. “Sweet Miss Sally” is sometimes titled “Mistress Annie” by some sources.

The above-mentioned partial setlist is taken from a circulating 40-minute audience recording of only fair quality that has never been issued on any mainstream boot. This audio circulates via custom CDR sources, typically alongside some of the audio from the December 17 Rutgers gig. The audio evidence suggests a fairly empty premises for this night’s show. While this is clearly a late period Bruce Springsteen Band club performance, the precise date and venue is not verified. The Student Prince is the most likely location, however, it is possible this audio is from one of the January 1972 shows at The Captain’s Garter or the April 15, 1972 Rutgers show.

1971-12-17 - THE LEDGE, RUTGERS UNIVERSITY, NEW BRUNSWICK, NJ

MARY LOUISE WATSON (9:27) / SHE’S A WOMAN (2:58) / WALKING THE DOG (8:40) / THE BALLAD OF JESSE JAMES (10:25) / WHEN YOU DANCE (end cut, 2:53)

Full set details are not known. One show, triple bill, with the five-member Bruce Springsteen Band headlining. Undercard acts are Southern Conspiracy and Powerhouse. Held at 'The Ledge', a club/coffeehouse located within the school’s Student Union facility.

The above-mentioned partial setlist is taken from a circulating 35-minute audience recording of poor quality that has a notorious history of being cannibalized. The MC’s introduction and the first two songs can be found on boot CD 'Down The Road Apiece' (Golden Stars). The remainder of the audio has never appeared on any mainstream boot but is circulating via private CDR sources, usually with no time/venue identification. Typically the final two or three tracks of this 35 minutes of audio are found combined with audio from an unrelated performance (see December 3 listing). "Mary Louise Watson" is also known by the title "Black Widow Spider". "Walking The Dog" is complete but it usually circulates incomplete. Only the first three minutes of "When You Dance" are in circulation. Unfortunately, it sounds as if the taper placed his microphone in the middle of a table of student drinkers, so the band’s performance is obscured by close proximity crowd noise and chatting. However the conversation does confirm the venue as being The Ledge. Although it seems likely that more of this performance would have been recorded by this source, only the 35 minutes of audio has surfaced to date. Collectors should note that the remaining 54 minutes of audio found on the 'Down The Road Apiece' CD is from an outdoor gig at Brookdale Community College on July 10, not from this Rutgers show as that CD’s liner notes claim.

One show, 9:30pm to 1.00am, with The Bruce Springsteen Band the sole act on the bill. A typical Bruce Springsteen Band gig at this club consisted of four 40 minute sets separated by healthy intermissions (2½ hrs total playing time).

This was the final-ever Bruce Springsteen Band gig at The Student Prince. Just a day or two following this show Springsteen drove out to California to visit his parents in San Mateo. Bruce drove with Tinker West, who had business matters to attend to and family to visit in California as well. At the time of his departure, Bruce was unsure if he was going to stay in California for several months or only for several weeks. This created an up-in-the-air future for all the other band members. Further gigs were performed at The Student Prince (without Springsteen) on December 24, 25 and 26 (billed as The Sundance Blues Band) and on December 31 (billed as 'Blue Midnight formally Sundance Blues'). As it turned out Springsteen only remained in California for several weeks. Bruce has implied that he performed some solo acoustic gigs while in California, but no specific details or eyewitness accounts have yet emerged. Bruce returned to New Jersey in late January 1972. By this stage, however, both Garry Tallent and David Sancious had moved to Richmond, both having accepted session players jobs at Alpha Sound Studios. The Bruce Springsteen Band was rekindled and due to Sancious-Tallent commitments at Alpha Studios many of the group’s February-March 1972 gigs were booked in the Richmond area.

1972-01-21 - THE CAPTAIN’S GARTER, NEPTUNE, NJ

BOTTLE OF RED WINE (3:58) / YOU KNOW MY LOVE (11:56) / WHY'S IT SO HARD (11:34) / CONFESSIN' THE BLUES (13:50) / SWEET MISS SALLY (9:32)

One show, triple bill, with The Sundance Blues Band opening for Inferno and headliner Ruby Falls & The Rock City Band. This was the opening of a three-night residency for the Sundance Blues Band, and the group’s only-ever performances at this venue. The line-up of the Sundance Blues Band for this residency was Southside Johnny, Steve Van Zandt, Garry Tallent, Vini Lopez, and David Sancious. Springsteen, who had only just returned from a month-long stay in California, joined the band onstage for elements of this and the following two nights shows.

Vini Lopez handles the lead vocal on Eric Clapton’s “Bottle Of Red Wine”. Steve Van Zandt provides the Greg Allman-ish vocal on Willie Dixon’s “You Know My Love” (mentioned as being inspired by Otis Rush’s cover version). A highlight is the mesmerizing “Why's It So Hard”, written by Springsteen but sung here by Southside Johnny (there’s no Bruce-led vocal rendition in circulation). David Sancious’ organ playing on this track is nothing short of spellbinding. Springsteen provides the lead vocal on Walter Brown’s immortal “Confessin’ The Blues” and the boogie romp “Sweet Miss Sally”. Bruce is playing rhythm guitar on all tracks. This material tends to circulate under a variety of dates, sometimes with audio from other 1971 shows added on.

Albee Tellone adds: "I recall going to one of the nights listed here but I don't recall seeing Bruce play with them. He may have arrived later as is his habit when sitting in. I left early due to lack of funds to buy beer. It was a dance club full of "greasers" and disco types. I didn't feel comfortable there anyway. Stevie got me through the door without paying the cover charge and bought me my first beer of two."

The above-mentioned setlist is taken from an audience recording of very good to excellent quality that is close to soundboard standard and makes for enjoyable listening. Although the audio has now been positively linked to this residency, it is not yet established from which of the three nights it emanates. There are discernible edits between songs so this may be a “compilation” of material from one or more of these three nights. There doesn’t sound as if there are more than a few dozen people in the audience, consistent with the group being the early evening opener for this residency.

1972-01-23 - THE CAPTAIN’S GARTER, NEPTUNE, NJ

No set details known. One show, triple bill, with The Sundance Blues Band opening for Inferno and headliner Ruby Falls & The Rock City Band. The line-up of the Sundance Blues Band for these shows was Southside Johnny, Van Zandt, Tallent, Lopez and David Sancious. Springsteen guests on guitar and vocals. Although it probably wasn’t planned as such, this night’s gig is believed to have been the final ever performance of The Sundance Blues Band.

BAND PERSONNEL NOTE: at this point in time, The Sundance Blues Band was the same personnel as The Bruce Springsteen Band with Southside Johnny as front man. Bruce had left for his family Christmas visit with no plans to return to NJ. A quick-thinking Van Zandt threw together a band called Blued Midnight but reverted to the old Sundance Blues Band name after one gig at the Student Prince. Things weren't going well and some of them wanted to relocate to Richmond, Virginia. David Sancious and Garry Tallent made the move and got work in a recording studio. Southside Johnny also moved to Richmond and joined a different band when Van Zandt and Lopez decided to return to NJ. Springsteen never considered moving to Richmond and pursued Mike Appel and Jim Cretecos as a solo artist.

1972-02-04 - THE BACK DOOR, RICHMOND, VA

One show, with The Bruce Springsteen Band the sole act on the bill. This was opening night of 9-show residency that encompassed three of the four weekends in February. Southside Johnny was a guest on the first weekend. However Southside’s harp playing is only heard on one track, “Bright Lights, Big City”. Bruce handles the harmonica on “Just Can't Change”, one of his better songwriting efforts of 1971. Two other standout songs are “Like A Stranger” and “Make Up Your Mind”. The most interesting track is the full band version of “Cowboys Of The Sea”, a song that clearly foreshadows the change of lyric style that Bruce was adopting at the time. Click the date/location link to view a series of photos of Springsteen and the band taken at The Back Door, as well as audio of Bruce's cover of Herman's Hermits' "I'm Into Something Good".

The above-mentioned twenty-one songs are culled from circulating audience and soundboard audio from the nine show residency that would seem to encompass parts of three of these nine shows, consequently there are multiple performances of some songs. A total of twenty-six songs were recorded, the above twenty-one plus another five which are very likely to date from a fourth show - February 26. Most of these twenty-six recordings have been in circulation since the mid-1980s and more than half have been issued on various mainstream bootleg titles. All twenty-six songs are available on the four-CD set 'The Really, Truly, Complete Backdoor Club Tapes' (Non-Uber Series Vol. 2). The first CD is soundboard sourced, taken directly from Tinker West's original reel tapes. The rest is audience recorded and the overall sound quality is good. This four-CD set was subsequently bootlegged as 'The Backdoor Club Tapes' (Midnight Dreamer). The so-called 'Backdoor Club Tapes' represent some of the most perplexing live audio to sort out, primarily due to the fact that nearly all the between-song audio appears to have been cut by the original taper prior to the audio entering into collector circulation. Because of the lack of audio continuity it is extremely difficult to tell which recordings emanate from which shows, and virtually impossible to decipher the correct running order. Although the shows of February 4 and 26 are often cited on trade lists, these two dates appear to be based on the fact that for many years these were the only two dates known to have been played at the club. It is now known the residency was much longer, so this material could be from any of the shows. However, it is more likely that most of it comes from the final weekend's performances. When performing "The Band's Just Boppin' The Blues", Bruce would mention the day of the week in the song. In this recording, he sings "it's a Sunday night", dating the recording of this particular song to either February 6, 20, or 27. There was no known show at The Back Door on February 13.

1972-02-05 - THE BACK DOOR, RICHMOND, VA

SAVE THE LAST DANCE FOR ME / SOUTHERN SUN / MOON BEAMS / I'M THE ONE / DOWN TO MEXICO / MAGIC KIND OF LOVING / WHEN YOU WALK WITH ME / SHE'S A WOMAN / SHE'S COOL / WHEN SHE WALKS / DOWN TO THE RIVERSIDE / A STORY

One show, with The Bruce Springsteen Band the sole act on the bill. The second of nine shows held at the club during February. The above setlist is culled from a handwritten setlist that was auctioned on an online auction website in 2010. Although the document is undated, the songs listed indicate that it is most likely to derive from the late '71-early '72 period. Therefore, although we have placed the information here in reality it could actually be sourced from any time around October 1971-February 1972. The thirteen-song track list is a mixture of known originals, covers and several that remain unidentified. The Drifters' "Save The Last Dance For Me" is the first song listed, the earliest known performance. The Springsteen-penned "Southern Sun" was recorded during the Demo studio sessions in May-June 1972. Two potentially unknown Springsteen originals follow, before a song listed only as 'E - A (?)'. "Down To Mexico" (written as "Do Run Daddy") and "Magic Kind Of Loving" were both definitely performed during the Band's residency at The Back Door. "When You Walk With Me" could be another original. "She's A Woman" was played at Rutgers University in December 1971 and "She's Cool" is likely to be a cover of the 1966 song by Greek garage-rock band Loubogg. The last three songs listed could all be Springsteen originals, indeed "Down To The Riverside" is likely to be Springsteen's title for the song commonly known as "Grandpa's Gone Down", a moving acoustic track about his grandfather. The song features several occurrences of the phrase "down to the riverside".

NO NEED / COWBOYS OF THE SEA / IF I WAS THE PRIEST / IT'S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY (fast version) / IT'S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY (slow version) / THE ANGEL / HOLLYWOOD KIDS / ARABIAN NIGHTS / FOR YOU

This is Bruce's complete live performance to an audience of three (Mike Appel, Jim Cretecos and Bob Spitz) that took place in Mike Appel's office at Wes Farrell's publishing company in New York City. Spitz recorded Springsteen on a reel-to-reel tape recorder. Although Bruce presented the material to Appel as all newly-created during his December-January trip to California, it is now known that "Cowboys Of The Sea" and "If I Was The Priest" were written before that trip. "It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City" was performed a second time on the request of Appel, who was dazzled by the lyrics. "For You" was apparently a shorter, not fully realized version of a song that Bruce seems not to have gotten around to finishing until the sessions for the first album were underway. All songs were played on acoustic guitar during this performance. After this performance Appel and Cretecos began putting the wheels in motion to sign Bruce to a comprehensive range of contracts, the first two of which (the 'Exclusive Management' and 'Exclusive Recording' Agreements) were signed almost four weeks to the day of this performance.

One show, with The Bruce Springsteen Band the sole act on the bill. The seventh of nine shows held at the club during February. This fifteen-song setlist is likely to the be the complete show and is confirmed as emanating from this date. Historically, the most significant track here is "Down To The Riverside" (a.k.a. "Grandpa's Gone Down"), which is about the death of Springsteen's grandfather. This tape represents the only known recording of the song. "Bless My Soul" is also known by the title "You Sure Can Dance". Curiously, the set does seem to include two renditions of "Cowboys Of The Sea", they are two distinct performances and have continuity. The second version opens the encore. Butch Ball at Stillwater Studios in Richmond provided the setlist information.

The setlist above is culled from an audience recording of good quality that unfortunately suffers from over-recording. It is currently not in circulation. The master reel-to-reel recording was listed for auction at Sotheby's in June 2014 with a rather hopeful estimate of $20,000-$30,000. It has been suggested that Springsteen's performance was recorded at the behest of John Hammond, who was keen to hear Springsteen's abilities fronting an electric band. See February 4 listing for details on circulating audio from this residency.

1972-03-14 - CHALLENGER EASTERN SURFBOARDS, HIGHLANDS, NJ

THE BALLAD OF JESSE JAMES (6:57) / IT'S ALL OVER NOW, BABY BLUE (11:30) / WHEN YOU DANCE (13:35) / LOOK TOWARDS THE LAND (9:50) / I'VE GOT TO HAVE YOU BABY (5:39) / FUNK SONG (6:25) / COMING HOME (8:44) / DO IT WITH A FEELING (partial, 1:26) / DO IT WITH A FEELING (cut, 11:14)

The above mentioned eight songs (plus a partial take) are taken from a high-quality soundboard recording of a Bruce Springsteen Band rehearsal held at Tinker West's Challenger Eastern Surfboards location. The band line-up is Van Zandt-Sancious-Tallent-Lopez. In addition to the seventy-six minutes of music there are nearly seven minutes of fascinating between-song banter, much of it between Springsteen and Tinker West, who Bruce jokingly refers to as 'Stinky'. Tinker appears to be testing some new recording equipment and the sound quality is uniformly excellent. It is evident from the discussions that the rehearsals had been going on for some time before the recording starts. It should be noted that this is not Challenger's more famous Wanamassa location that Bruce had lived in during the 1969-70 Steel Mill era. Tinker West had relocated the factory to Highlands, NJ in mid-1971 and had then constructed a more professional rehearsal room.

The standout track here is "When You Dance". Although rough quality live renditions exist, this is a clear rendition, with astounding Springsteen-Van Zandt dual lead guitar interplay. Noteworthy as well is "Funk Song" (also known as "Funk Says Right On"). There are no live renditions of "Funk Song" from this period circulating, however, Bruce surprisingly resurrected it during a few shows early on the Born To Run Tour (see gig listings for July 23, 1975 , July 19, 1975 and August 8, 1975 ). In addition to the Dylan's "All Over Now Baby Blue", there is also a cover of "I've Got To Have You Baby", an obscure 1956 R&B single by Jimmy Jones & The Pretenders.

"Look Towards The Land" first surfaced on the boot 'Bound For Glory' (Flamingo), albeit in vastly reduced sound quality to that found on the master tape. "The Ballad Of Jesse James" (also known by the titles "Don't You Want To Be An Outlaw" or "Billy") first surfaced on 'Deep Down In The Vaults' (E Street). The sound quality on this boot is only slightly reduced from the master tape. "The Ballad Of Jesse James" is officially available on Chapter And Verse, the companion album to Springsteen's Born To Run autobiography. It has been edited by removing a few verses from the middle of the song, reducing the length by around a minute-and-a-half to 5:31.

In early 2007 the soundboard of the first six songs listed above (sixty-two minutes of audio) finally surfaced in excellent quality into the mainstream collector market via the title 'Uber Series #26' and subsequently remastered as 'Prodigal Son Meets The Ubers #5' (Prodigal Son) and 'The Early Uber Collection' (Ev2). However, this audio is only the first two reels recorded, a third reel also exists which contains two further titles; "Coming Home", and two takes of "Do It With A Feeling". The first take of the latter is aborted after the opening ninety seconds or so, while the second is cut short at the end of the reel. It is probable that this reel was recorded before the other two, and possible that other reels in addition to these three were recorded. The third reel is not currently in general circulation; however, audio of "Coming Home" entered circulation in 2017 as part of the 'Odds & Sods' collection.

1972-03-17 - RICHMOND ARENA, RICHMOND, VA

Please note that due to the discovery of a new source the audio found on CDs such as 'Non Über Project Volume One' and CDR 'Fantastic Virginia' (Vintage Masters) can now be positively dated to a concert at the University of Richmond in Richmond, VA on October 23, 1971. See that listing for further information.

No set details known. One show, quadruple bill, with The Bruce Springsteen Band opening the evening’s festivities for Bang, The Mike Quatro Jam Band and Mitch Ryder & Detroit. This was a festival-styled show, with each act allocated 80-90 minute time slots. Although Mitch Ryder & Detroit were top-billed it was electronic space music favorite The Mike Quatro Jam Band (70s rocker Suzi Quatro’s brother) who performed last. In an attempt to minimize the 6,500 seat Richmond Arena’s lack of intimacy and notorious echo problems the promoter revamped the seating layout to house 4,500 by rotating the stage 90 degrees and placing it against the centre wall. The stage was also enlarged to allow two bands to be set up simultaneously, reducing the delay between acts. However, an article in the following day’s paper noted a turnout of only about 1,000. A newspaper review of the show briefly mentions Springsteen and notes the wide variety of styles performed in his set.

1972-04-00 - FREEHOLD TOWNSHIP HIGH SCHOOL, FREEHOLD, NJ

DOWN TO THE RIVERSIDE

Springsteen gives an unadvertised 45-minute solo performance (on a grand piano rented specifically for Bruce by promoter Victor Wasylczenko). Headliner for this show was Sunny Jim, with Tumbleweed the opener. It should be noted that there were two High Schools serving the Freehold area and Freehold Township High School is not the one Bruce graduated from in June 1967. Springsteen performed in between both groups and he ended his performance with "Down To The Riverside", a song Bruce mentioned to the audience he had just written. This composition is known from a soundboard recording of a gig at The Back Door in Richmond, VA from February 25, 1972 as well as Appel-Cretecos song inventory documents (it hasn’t surfaced among the pool of early demos Bruce recorded). The song is also known as "Grandpa's Gone Down" - see the February 25 entry for more details. The remaining song titles Bruce played during this show are unverified.

No set details known. One show, double bill, with The Bruce Springsteen Band (Springsteen-Van Zandt-Sancious-Tallent-Lopez) headlining. The opening group, Albee & The Hired Hands, featured a lineup on this night of Albee Tellone (acoustic guitar, vocals), Dennis Monahan (bass), Kevin Kavanaugh (keyboards), former Castiles drummer Vinnie Manniello (drums) plus Steve Van Zandt on lead guitar and mandolin. Van Zandt played for both groups this night. He was an on and off member of Albee’s band in 1970 and later during mid '71-mid '72 when the Bruce Springsteen Band's schedule permitted it. Manniello had joined in February 1972 (replacing Bobby Williams) but this gig turned out to be Manniello’s final show in Albee’s band. There were power problems during this concert that affected some of the Bruce Springsteen Band's instruments. The promoter of this show was Randy Jewkes, the then-proprietor of 'Room II', a Point Pleasant Coffee House. Sandy Mack and Albee Tellone provided some details.

1972-05-02 - CBS BUILDING, NEW YORK CITY, NY

IT'S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY / GROWIN' UP / MARY QUEEN OF ARKANSAS / IF I WAS THE PRIEST

One (informal) private audition that took place in front of an audience of two (John Hammond and Mike Appel) around 10:30am upstairs in Hammond's office in the A & R Department at Columbia Records. The above-mentioned setlist is culled from the scattered, collective recollections of the attendees. All songs were performed on an acoustic guitar with a cracked neck borrowed from Springsteen's Castiles bandmate Vinnie Manniello. This performance was not recorded. It lasted 30-40 minutes, so one or two additional songs were probably played but those titles have never been articulated. Bruce's "set" began with "It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City", after which Hammond said, "you've got to be on Columbia Records". In a 1980 interview Hammond mentioned he wasn't all that enamored with "Mary Queen Of Arkansas", but that he loved all the other songs Bruce performed that morning. Springsteen played "If I Was The Priest" only after a probing Hammond requested that Bruce sing something he wouldn't otherwise play live. Springsteen has since mentioned that "If I Was The Priest" was written in late 1970 or early 1971 and that he'd performed it live during his late 1971 residency at The Student Prince. When Bruce was finished with this audition Hammond mentioned that he would need to see how Bruce interacted in front of a live audience, so Appel immediately went about organizing a local club performance for that evening.

1972-05-02 - GASLIGHT AU GO GO, NEW YORK CITY, NY

GROWIN’ UP / IT’S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY / IF I WAS THE PRIEST / ARABIAN NIGHTS

One (informal) show. This famous performance was organized by Mike Appel within hours of the morning audition meeting with John Hammond (see above listing). The 300 seat Gaslight Au Go Go had opened in April 1971 as a financially necessitated merger of two long-established Greenwich Village clubs, the rock-dominated Café Au Go Go and the folk-orientated Village Gaslight (the 100 seat McDougal Street club made famous by Bob Dylan). The merged entity was called 'Gaslight Au Go Go' and it was located in the 152 Bleeker Street home of the former Café Au Go Go. The legendary Sam Hood owned both the old and new Gaslight businesses. The Gaslight Au Go Go wasn’t Bruce’s preferred choice for this performance. The Bitter End, Max’s Kansas City and Kenny’s Castaways were approached first, but none could accommodate a Springsteen billing on such short notice.

Evidence from surviving promotional material indicates the scheduled performers at Gaslight Au Go Go on the night of May 2 were Charlie Musselwhite (headlining) with Garland Jeffreys (support). It is likely they were performing two shows at the club’s regular starting times of 9:00pm and 11:30pm. Springsteen was slotted into a very early evening time slot, well before the first of the Musselwhite / Jeffreys' shows started. There is evidence (from comments made by Springsteen and Appel) that this early evening time slot this night may have been booked with unadvertised amateur comedy acts. Bruce’s performance lasted about 30 minutes and included around five-six songs. Both Springsteen and Appel have mentioned the first two above-mentioned setlist tracks as having been played, and Bruce makes note of the other two in Born To Run. He claims the club was Gerde's Folk City, but could well be mistaken since he correctly identifies the manager as Sam Hood. There is no circulating audio/video from this performance, although both video and audio from Springsteen performances at Max’s Kansas City in mid-August are sometimes incorrectly attributed to this gig.

John Hammond attended this show, was impressed, and invited Springsteen back to CBS the following day to make a studio demo audition tape.
00Photo-32.png

1972-05-03 - CBS BUILDING, NEW YORK CITY, NY

The day after his audition with John Hammond, Springsteen traveled to CBS Studios to lay down a set of demos in the studio. Five days later, John Hammond sent the recording to Columbia Records President Clive Davis, with a note: 'Here is a copy of a couple of the reels of Bruce Springsteen, a very talented kid who recorded these twelve songs in a period of around two hours last Wednesday . . . I think we better act quickly because many people heard the boy at The Gaslight so that his fame is beginning to spread.' Davis responded the next day 'I love Bruce Springsteen! He's an original in every respect. I'd like to meet him if you can arrange it.' A meeting between the two transpired a few days later. In 1976 Springsteen recounted the experience during a performance of "Growin' Up" in Santa Monica, CA: 'I get to the CBS building with my manager and my lawyer. We get in the audition elevator, a special elevator marked “X”. We shoot up to the clouds, passing the stars, passing all the planets. We finally get up, the doors open up, they frisk me a few times, and there at this big, solid gold desk, in a long, white robe, with a little wreath around his head was Clive Davis. He had angels taking notes and flying all around. I said “Mr. Davis…I wanna be a rock ’n’ roll star”. But first he heard my confession, and he said…”Sign here”… I put my name on that line and then...'

Fourteen tracks were recorded, encompassing twelve songs: "Mary Queen Of Arkansas", "Growin' Up", "Does This Bus Stop At 82nd Street", "It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City", "The Angel", "Arabian Nights", "Jazz Musician", "If I Was The Priest", "Two Hearts In True Waltz Time", "Street Queen", "Southern Sun", and "Cowboys Of The Sea". See the Demo section of On The Tracks for more details on this session.


1972-06-00 - PRIVATE PROPERTY, POINT PLEASANT, NJ

No set details known. One show, with the Bruce Springsteen Band giving an unadvertised performance to about 100 people at a warehouse party location on a private property. This free gig happened either during or immediately following the three days of pre-studio rehearsals for the first Springsteen LP Greetings From Asbury Park, NJ that took place in late June somewhere within the Beacon Manor Complex in Point Pleasant Beach. It would seem that Clarence and Danny Federici did not perform, as they weren’t involved in the pre-studio rehearsals.

1972-06-17 - THE SHIPBOTTOM LOUNGE, POINT PLEASANT BEACH, NJ

No set details known. Bruce makes a guest appearance with Norman Seldin & The Joyful Noyze (featuring Clarence Clemons). Joyful Noyze lead singer Karen Cassidy had resigned in early 1972 and Clarence was, at this stage, the group’s focal point. This is believed to have been the first time Bruce and Clarence had played together since Clarence’s now famous Student Prince walk-in jam with Springsteen in September 1971. Seldin and his band were booked for consecutive Fri-Sat shows at The Shipbottom from June 16 to July 8. The Shipbottom Lounge was located in the Beacon Manor Hotel. Bruce did not arrive with his guitar, he borrowed one from the band. Bruce sang a couple of songs, including one by Chuck Berry.

No set details known. One show, 5:00pm, with the Bruce Springsteen Band (listed in the Red Bank Register as the Bruce Springsteen Blues Band) the only artist on the bill, a benefit for 1972 Presidential candidate George McGovern. It is not known how long Bruce's performance lasted but the $3.00 donation also included a ticket to see the evening movie, Frogs, starring Ray Milland. The money raised from this event was used to keep the McGovern office in Shrewsbury running and to send delegates to the Democratic convention. Brucebase reader Larry comments: "I was going through a friend’s Bruce collection, trying to date his early memorabilia and I found this handmade poster, which came from the Theater's Box Office."

Bruce confirmed opening for Odetta in a November 1992 Musician Magazine interview with Bill Flanagan and implies that the venue in question was Max’s Kansas City. Bruce was unclear if he opened for Odetta for one night or for multiple nights. Another recollection suggests the venue was not Max’s Kansas City but, rather, Gerde’s Folk City.

1972-08-09 - MAX'S KANSAS CITY, NEW YORK CITY, NY

No set details known. Two shows, triple bill, with the bottom-billed Springsteen (solo) opening for headliner Dave Van Ronk and the second-billed Doris Abrahams.

Van Ronk’s six-night (twelve-show) residency at Max's Kansas City included Bruce’s first series of 'official' public performances after signing with Columbia, although there was absolutely no CBS sponsored promotion of the event. The club’s earliest promotional material for this residency only mentions Dave Van Ronk and not the two unknown 'understudies'. A later advertisement mentions Van Ronk and Abrahams, but not Springsteen. However, an advertisement from mid-residency mentions Bruce. It is likely that Bruce was a last-minute addition to the billing but performed at all the shows. Bruce’s inclusion on the bill may have been arranged by John Hammond, a good friend of Van Ronk. Springsteen has briefly mentioned opening for Van Ronk, with his most well-known comments coming during the 1990 Christic Benefit gigs. Shortly before Van Ronk died he also acknowledged letting Bruce open for him during his 1972 residency at Max's (Van Ronk's only appearances at the club that year). Promoter Victor 'Igor' Wasylczenko has commented to Brucebase that he attended one of these Van Ronk dates, Bruce was definitely the opener, and he ended up giving him a ride home to Asbury Park after the show (they lived near each other at the time).

Definitely one, probably two, and possibly several of Bruce's shows during this residency were audio and video recorded in their entirety, utilizing Max's (crude by today's standards) in-house video camera. It is believed the recording was carried out at the behest of Columbia, who wanted footage of Bruce for potential promotional use.

1972-08-10 - MAX'S KANSAS CITY, NEW YORK CITY, NY

HENRY BOY / DOES THIS BUS STOP AT 82ND STREET? / GROWIN' UP

Two shows, triple bill, with Springsteen (solo) opening for headliner Dave Van Ronk and folk stylist Doris Abrahams. Each of Bruce's shows was limited to about thirty minutes (perhaps four or five songs). The second song listed above, "Does This Bus Stop At 82nd Street?" was first shown to the public at "An Evening with Thom Zimny", an event held at Monmouth University on September 23, 2014. During his introduction to the song, Bruce explains that he wrote half of the song on a bus, the other half on a train. This could very well be his first live performance of the song.

Very brief audio-video excerpts of both "Henry Boy" and "Growin' Up" from one of the twelve shows during this August 1972 Max’s residency first surfaced in a 1990 documentary about John Hammond called From Bessie Smith to Bruce Springsteen. The complete audio-video of both songs has since leaked out and is circulating among collectors. These complete takes represent what was originally supplied to the Hammond film producers by CBS. The producers were only allowed to use brief excerpts of the two songs in the documentary and were not supplied any footage of the rest of the show. “Henry Boy” is the opening number of Bruce's show and “Growin’ Up” is the closing number. The remainder of the show (probably only a couple of songs, for a total of around thirty minutes) exists in CBS’s vault but has never circulated. The other show this night may also have been filmed. The video footage is sometimes mis-identified as emanating from Springsteen's appearance at Gaslight Au Go Go in May 1972. Video of both songs is circulating in two variations. One version shows the MC (believed to be Max's Kansas City manager Sam Hood) take the stage and introduce Bruce prior to "Henry Boy". The other version has the entire MC introduction segment deleted. Following "Growin” Up" Bruce begins to introduce the artist who is to follow him by stating to the crowd "here's a protégée of mine", at which point the video ends before the name of the performer is mentioned. It would seem that Bruce is using the word 'protégée' in its feminine context and that he is referring to Doris Abrahams. In a 1978 interview Bruce also mentions playing the Night Owl and it is likely that it was around this time. Brucebase has placed these audio/video segments under this date but it could be from any of the shows during this residency.

Two shows, triple bill, with Springsteen (solo) opening for headliner Dave Van Ronk and folk stylist Doris Abrahams. Each of Bruce’s shows was limited to about 30 minutes (three to five songs). All together Springsteen performed twelve shows during his stand at Max's Kansas City, with three to five songs played per show (approximately 40 to 60 song performances over the course of the week). Although the setlist details for these shows is not known, it is highly likely that all ten songs from the Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J. album were performed. As well as the Greetings LP material (and in addition to "Henry Boy", which is on the video), the other songs likely to have been played during this residency are those known to have been recorded at 914 Sound Studio in Blauvelt, NY for potential inclusion on the debut album. These include "Arabian Nights", "Two Hearts In True Waltz Time", the still uncirculating/unheard song "Let The Words", "Visitation At Fort Horn", "Lady And The Doctor", "Circus Song" and "Song For Orphans". Two other major songs written by Bruce around this time, "Balboa vs The Earthslayer" and "Calvin Jones & The Thirteenth Apostle", may also have been performed over the course of these shows.

No set details known. Springsteen plays some early evening solo acoustic shows during the New York Dolls five night (August 30 - September 3) residency at the club. Bruce was not part of the bill, he played several hours prior to the Dolls show. Springsteen seems to positively confirm his non-advertised appearance(s) at Max’s during this week when, in a November 1992 Musician magazine interview with Bill Flanagan, Bruce commented: “I use to come down to Max’s Kansas City and play by myself... and then late at night the New York Dolls would play at Max’s, they’d play at 2.00am". This five night residency was the Dolls’ only one at the club in 1972. It is still not verified if Springsteen played one, some or all of these five nights.

1972-09-02 - HUDDY PARK, HIGHLANDS, NJ

THIS IS MY CONFESSION / DOWN THE ROAD APIECE / WATER STATION / BABY, PLEASE DON'T GO

A twelve hour 'end of summer' outdoor show, billed as the first annual Highlands Art / Music Fair. Headlining acts include the Tinker West managed local band Odin, as well as New Jersey-based folk rock band Montana Flintlock, who were also signed by Mike Appel, trading as Laurel Canyon Ltd. Columbia were briefly interested in signing the band to their label, before changing their minds. Springsteen (who at this point had completed his first album but had still not put together a touring band) makes an unscheduled guest appearance near the end of the show after an invitation from Odin's Tom Cohen, singing and performing several songs with the band. First song appears to be a Springsteen composition, perhaps titled "This Is My Confession". Cohen and Springsteen exchange guitar solos on this track. Next up is "Down The Road Apiece". After a few moments the power goes out, and they restart the song once power returns. A Springsteen original, called Water Station, is next up, with the music and lyrics made up on the spot. Four minutes in the power goes out again, followed by an amusing interchange between Tinker and the band. Power is restored, and the band perform Big Joe Williams' "Baby, Please Don't Go". Apparently Springsteen only knows lyrics for the first verse, so fills in with lyrics from "It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City". Other bands on the bill are Crazy Lester And The Blue Water Rangers, Taylors Mills Road, Lee Reiser (erroneously spelt Reisner in a newspaper article), and Charlotte.

A soundboard tape of the entire Odin performance (including Bruce’s segment) recorded by Tinker West survives in private hands but is not in circulation. Songs in Odin's set include Chuck Berry's "Maybellene" and Gary U.S. Bonds' "New Orleans".

1972-09-04 - MAX'S KANSAS CITY, NEW YORK CITY, NY

No set details known. One (informal) show, with Springsteen (solo) performing during a late afternoon-early evening 'open-mic' Monday at the club. This was the Labor Day holiday and no pre-advertised acts were booked. As fate would have it, resident Greenwich Village folkie David Blue happened to be socializing downstairs at Max’s prior to his own gig later in the evening at The Bitter End. In a 1992 interview in Musician Magazine Springsteen seemingly made reference to this specific performance, commenting: “I used to come down to Max’s Kansas City and play by myself... David Blue came down one night and as I was walking off stage said ‘hey man that was great, come with me’. We got in a cab and went downtown to The Bitter End, where I (first) met Jackson Browne.”

1972-09-04 - THE BITTER END, NEW YORK CITY, NY

WILD BILLY'S CIRCUS STORY

One (informal) show, with Springsteen (solo) performing an unscheduled 'guest set' at a Jackson Browne / David Blue show. Browne has stated that Bruce played for almost an hour, which would encompass seven or eight songs. This was the final night of a six-night (twelve-show) residency by Browne and Blue at the club. In a 1979 radio interview Browne commented on his first-ever meeting with Springsteen and the event: “David Blue walks in before the show with this guy in tow ‘Jackson this is Bruce and… Jackson, you gotta hear him... can he do a guest set tonight?’ So I said sure. He (Bruce) went out there for about an hour and proceeded to do the greatest songs I’d ever heard, with just his guitar and (my) piano. When he got off stage I said “man, where the hell have you been hiding!”. Bruce performed during the intermission between the Blue and Browne sets. During his Rock 'n' Roll Hall Of Fame induction speech for Jackson, Springsteen thanked Browne for letting him get up and play at this show.

1972-09-00 - GASLIGHT AU GO GO, NEW YORK CITY, NY

No set details known. Springsteen jumps on stage at a Bonnie Raitt gig and plays a song. Bruce mentions the event during the Christic Benefit concerts in 1990, in which Raitt took part: "Oh yeah! It's funny, Jackson and Bonnie and I, we met about uh, almost 20 years ago. I was playing at Max's Kansas City (cheers). And this fella, David Blue came and pulled me off stage and said "Man, you gotta come downtown with me". And Jackson was playing at the Bitter End, and Bonnie was playing across the street at the Cafe Au Go Go, and I got up and I sang a song."

1972-10-25 - THE SHIPBOTTOM LOUNGE, POINT PLEASANT BEACH, NJ

No set details known. Pre-tour rehearsals for the Greetings From Asbury Park tour took place at Bill Herring's guitar shop in Point Pleasant, NJ during the autumn of 1972, Verified by equipment coordinator Albee Tellone. Before acquiring the name "E Street Band", Bruce’s 'new band' lineup consisted of Danny Federici, Garry Tallent, Vini Lopez and Clarence Clemons (who had played his final show with Norman Seldin’s Joyful Noyze at the Club Plaza in Bayville, NJ on October 21). Although information is sketchy it is believed Bruce and the band gave an unadvertised, impromptu performance in the Beacon Hotel’s Nightclub (The Shipbottom Lounge). Albee was not present at the Shipbottom and cannot verify that it happened. Attached is a photo of the rehearsal location as it looks today. Courtesy of Steve Bonham and Albee Tellone.

1972-10-28 - HOLLINGER FIELD HOUSE, WEST CHESTER COLLEGE, WEST CHESTER, PA

No set details known. One show (part of Homecoming festivities), triple bill, with Springsteen bottom-billed and opening for the second-billed acapella group The Persuasions and headlining comedy duo Cheech & Chong. Bruce and the boys were a last-minute addition to the show itinerary. According to one of the College’s concert organizers soon after Springsteen began his performance a dispute erupted backstage with Cheech & Chong’s management, who apparently were upset they had not been informed a third act had been booked. The end result was that Springsteen was forced to end his set prematurely, after only about six songs. A very brief review in the school’s newspaper gives the show a positive overall review but does not give any details on Springsteen’s set. Bruce would make a return appearance at West Chester on November 22, 1974 and a review of that show notes that Springsteen was 'heckled off the stage' at the 1972 show. The College's 'Serpentine' 1973 yearbook does feature this event, but unfortunately only includes photographs of The Persuasions and Cheech & Chong. This West Chester show is currently the earliest known public performance of the as-yet unnamed 'E Street Band' (Clemons, Federici, Lopez, Tallent).

This show was the first that Springsteen played with his now-iconic electric guitar, a "1950s mutt with a Telecaster body and an Esquire neck", as Bruce describes it in Born To Run. He had bought the guitar from Phil Petillo's shop in Belmar for $185, and it would be his primary guitar for the next forty years.

1972-10-29 - NATIONAL GUARD ARMORY, LONG BRANCH, NJ

MARY QUEEN OF ARKANSAS / THUNDERCRACK

Full set details are not known. One show, with Bruce and his new band headlining the '2nd Annual Halloween Concert' at the Armory (see October 31, 1971 for the first show). This was a triple bill that also featured Odin and Tumbleweed. The show was organized and promoted by Bruce's former manager, Tinker West, who also handled the sound systems of all three bands for this show. Bruce is introduced as a 'Columbia Recording Artist'. The performance structure at this show would mirror the one utilized consistently for the next year (Bruce performed a short solo set and then brought on the band for the rest of the evening). Bruce and the band's performance lasted about 70 minutes and encompassed about eight or nine songs. One attendee has a memory of both "Santa Ana" and "Zero And Blind Terry" being played, although that seems unlikely (especially "Zero") given other information about Bruce's creation process for these two compositions. Setlists from this time are rare, but the set includes the earliest known performance of "Thundercrack".

There is no audio of this show in circulation.

1972-11-11 - COLLEGE GYMNASIUM, YORK COLLEGE OF PENNSYLVANIA, YORK, PA

No set details known. One show, double bill, with Bruce and the band opening for headliner Crazy Horse (who's line-up here did not include Danny Whitten or Nils Lofgren). Bruce had previously opened a show for Crazy Horse (see February 12, 1972 listing). Springsteen performed about an 80-minute set at this show which was held in the College Gymnasium. Albee Tellone comments on the Greasy Lake website: "This was my first gig as roadie for them. By 'them' I mean Bruce and the the band with no name, or the Pre-Street Band as I like to call them. Bare bones stage. Bruce played guitar and piano. Danny played organ, Garry on bass and of course Clarence and Vini doing their thing". Photographs of this show were taken for the college newspaper and the photographer was approached by Mike Appel for copies. These photographs have not, as yet, surfaced.

1972-11-25 - COBO HALL, DETROIT, MI

No set details known. Bruce and the band perform a free promotional gig (organized by Mike Appel) at the 1972 Detroit Auto Show along with a number of other bands. The exhibition ran from November 18 to 26 and the theme was the circus with numerous clowns at the event. It is possible that Appel was able to get the band a slot due to the soon-to-be-released "Wild Billy's Circus Story". The band play on a temporary riser in a large showroom, as they start their set Danny's amp fails because it is plugged into a 220 volt line rather than the correct 110 volt. The amp literally had smoke pouring out of it and was a total loss. The other amps had to be quickly unplugged to prevent further damage.

Albee Tellone recalled that "the amps started to burn up right away when they started the first song. It was a disaster. We were confused and upset. We drove home right away thinking "what the fuck happened?". Federici's amp was a total loss. Bruce's Marshall head was fried too but we took it to get repaired in NJ."

1972-12-05 - KENNY'S CASTAWAYS, NEW YORK CITY, NY

No set details known. Two shows, with Bruce and the boys the sole act on the bill. Opening of a six-night (twelve-show) residency at this famous East Side supper club, which closed in September 2012. This was Springsteen and the band's first extended club residency of the Greetings Tour. Each show was 80-90 minutes in duration and included an opening 'solo' segment featuring two or three songs, followed by a band segment. Albee Tellone believes that the solo segment was developed for the Kenny's Castaways shows, when Bruce hadn't rehearsed enough songs with the band for a long night club engagement.

1972-12-07 - CHAPEL, OSSINING CORRECTIONAL FACILITY, OSSINING, NY

THEM CHANGES / BLUES IN C

One early afternoon show for inmates of 'Sing Sing Prison', with Springsteen and the boys the sole act on the bill. This nearly two hour show was held in the Prison Chapel. Apparently Mike Appel organized this as a bit of publicity stunt, and it did indeed attract reporters from Crawdaddy Magazine. A performance at this prison isn’t as bizarre as it may seem, as there had been a similar concert on November 22 starring Joan Baez and BB King that was filmed and is available on video.

Setlist-wise this has to rank (along with February 23, 1974) as the most unique show ever performed by Bruce and the band since it featured nearly all cover material, including a Clarence Clemons vocal rendition of Buddy Miles’ “Them Changes”. Greetings Tour Sound Manager Albee Tellone has commented that an inmate with a saxophone was invited onstage to play with the band on a blues number in the key of C (possibly “Secret To The Blues”). The inmate was playing a small "C Melody" saxophone tuned to the key of C. It was the only key he could play in, so Bruce accommodated his presence by playing in C. Albee recalled that one of the lines in the tune said, "she had limousine legs" - which brought a cheer from the crowd on inmates. Springsteen made reference to this gig in a 1973 Columbia Records media release. Of the inmate audience he comments: “They’re tough dudes. They got nobody to impress at all. It was good that they liked us”. Albee received a call from photographer Eric Meola (of Born to Run fame) asking about this show and the inmate with the sax. He was trying to track him down because he had taken a photo of him playing on that same stage with BB King and Joan Baez a few months before Springsteen performed there. Meola later told Tellone that the man was located but was uncooperative.

Following this show Springsteen and the band made the 90 minute drive to New York City to play two further shows that evening at Kenny’s Castaways.

1972-12-07 - KENNY'S CASTAWAYS, NEW YORK CITY, NY

WILD BILLY'S CIRCUS STORY / SONG FOR ORPHANS / BLINDED BY THE LIGHT / FOR YOU

Two shows, with Bruce and the boys the sole act on the bill. Each show was 80-90 minutes in duration and included an opening 'solo' segment featuring two or three songs, followed by a band segment. This show was detailed in Springsteen's first major interview, published in the March 1973 issue of Crawdaddy! magazine. The above four songs are mentioned in the article. The first two were played acoustically and the last two were played with the band. These are the earliest known live versions of all four songs.

Each show was 80-90 minutes in duration and included an opening 'solo' segment featuring two or three songs followed by a band segment. Although no specific Kenny's Castaways setlist details have yet come to light, it is highly likely that all ten songs from the soon-to-be-released Greetings From Asbury Park, NJ album were performed over the course of the twelve shows that encompassed the residency. It is also likely that Bruce utilized his opening solo segment to perform a number of compositions that weren't going to be issued on the debut album, such as "Bishop Danced", "Song For Orphans" and "Circus Song".

No set details known. Two shows, double billing, with Springsteen and band opening for headliner David Bromberg. Opening night of a seven-day (14-show) residency at this famous Jazz-heritage club. Although Bruce was the undercard, David Bromberg allowed him to perform about 80 minutes at each show. Each show encompassed a couple of solo performances followed by seven or eight songs with the band. During his August 14, 1992 show in Worcester, Bruce mentions that he played "Growin' Up" during his stand at Paul's Mall.

1973-01-09 - RADIO STATION WBCN-FM, BOSTON, MA

SATIN DOLL (1.17) / BISHOP DANCED (3.27) / WILD BILLY'S CIRCUS STORY (5.02) / SONG FOR ORPHANS (7.30) / DOES THIS BUS STOP AT 82ND STREET? (5.32) / BLINDED BY THE LIGHT (4.50)

Bruce's first-ever radio station performance and still the earliest circulating 'live' material with what would become the E Street Band. The silky-voiced female DJ is the legendary Maxanne Sartori. There are some funny moments in this show particularly when Bruce introduces Clarence as his biological brother. At one point Sartori asks Bruce to perform his mysterious "long-lost hit from the 60s", to which Bruce replies that people will have to come to Paul's Mall to hear it in the “Las Vegas part of the show”. In addition to the band (minus Lopez), co-manager Jim Cretecos, roadie/soundman Albee 'Albany Al' Tellone and CBS rep Ed Hynes are in the broadcast studio, they provide the party-like background vocals on "Blinded By The Light". The last verse of "Wild Billy's Circus Story" features the alternative, early "hear the liar" lyric which would remain in place for the next few months. By the time of the Ahmanson Theatre appearance in May 1973, the lyric will have evolved into the familiar "and the strong man...".

The very good quality circulating audio recorded off the airways is available on the CD 'Bound For Glory'. The CDs 'WBCN Studios 1973' (Great Dane) and 'Acoustic Radio 1973' (Good Ship Funke) are missing nearly all of "Blinded By The Light" as well as the concluding discussions about Bruce's upcoming tour plans. Commercially released in the UK by Left Field Media, also with the title 'Bound For Glory'. This CD includes the April 24 radio broadcast from the Main Point. Allegedly a complete (but poor quality) tape of the show was circulating briefly in the Boston area during the mid-70s, but it seems to have vanished from the tape trading pool.

1973-01-18 - MY FATHER'S PLACE, ROSLYN, NY

No set details known. Two shows, double billing, with Springsteen and band opening for headliner The Paul Winter Consort. Opening night of a four-night (eight-show) residency at the small ~400 capacity club on Long Island. Club manager Michael Epstein had booked Springsteen in November 1972 because the owner of My Father's Place had a son who was married to Mike Appel's sister. Epstein thought Springsteen was a solo folk singer, so he placed Bruce on the bill with Paul Winter's quiet, India-influenced band. There was a small contingent of New Jersey shore area locals who came to the show each night specifically to listen to Springsteen, so the four nights proved to be a clash of musical as well as audience styles, in Epstein's words, "fifty partying Asbury Park hippies dancing on tables and 300 middle-aged suburbanites trying to meditate".

Epstein has commented "I was astounded at the magic of Springsteen... Paul Winter never spoke with me again". Immediately following this show the entire band drove to Chicago together in a rented car, with Bruce travelling with the road crew in the equipment van.

1973-01-24 - THE QUIET KNIGHT, CHICAGO, IL

No set details known. One show, double bill, with Springsteen and band opening for headlining a cappella group The Persuasions. Bruce's performances during this five-night (five-show) residency were about 60 minutes and for the most part consisted of two opening acoustic numbers followed by four or five songs with his band. This was followed by a 90-minute performance by The Persuasions. The opening of this five-night residency at the 250-seat Quiet Knight was reviewed by Chicago Tribune critic Lynn Van Matre, who only briefly mentions Springsteen but does call him "an engrossing opening act". Although The Persuasions were personally friendly and accommodating to Bruce and the band, this (like the previous week’s residency at My Father’s Place) was a stylistic mismatch that resulted in most of the audience being disgruntled and disinterested in the unknown Springsteen.

Two shows, double billing, with Springsteen and band opening for headliner Biff Rose. This was the opening of a six-night (12-show) residency at the club. As undercard Bruce’s performances would have been limited to about 60 minutes per show. Both shows feature an introduction by Max's owner Mickey Ruskin. To start each show Bruce plays two solo numbers before bringing out the band.

By prior arrangement with Mike Appel and Columbia Records, D.I.R. Broadcasting Corp was on hand to gather performance recordings of Bruce for use on its upcoming new syndicated radio program called “King Biscuit Flower Hour”. The DIR Engineers had been in Buffalo two days earlier recording The Mahavishnu Orchestra and the week before that in Dallas recording a Blood Sweat & Tears concert. The King Biscuit Flower Hour used a two-four week delayed broadcast formula and the show made its debut on February 18 and February 19 (date depended on the locale). As it turned out the program that aired featured mostly Blood, Sweat & Tears (major stars at this time). Only one Mahavishnu Orchestra track was broadcast and only one Springsteen song, “Bishop Danced”. This is the recording of “Bishop Danced” that ended up on the official Tracks boxed set, although the liner notes mistakenly list the broadcast date as the recording date. "Bishop Danced" was re-broadcast by King Biscuit several times in subsequent years, including part one of the 500th Broadcast Celebration of the program on April 15, 1984. "Mary Queen Of Arkansas" and "Spirit In The Night" were aired a week later in part two. "Spirit In The Night" also formed part of the pre-show broadcast of the Stockholm 1988 concert, but none of the other Springsteen material recorded by them on this night was ever aired, perhaps due to rights issues. In 1980 "Bishop Danced" formed part of a program titled "Rock On The Road (A Million Miles of Rock 'N' Roll)" that was produced by D.I.R. Broadcasting and aired on radio stations across the country on November 7, 8 and 9, depending on the radio station. A memo was distributed to all radio stations by D.I.R. on November 8 issuing an instruction to not air the Springsteen content, which also included the promotional recording of "Prove It All Night" from July 1, 1978 and an excerpt of a radio interview with Dave Herman from the same year. Presumably D.I.R. did not have permission to use Springsteen's material and only realised after the program was aired on November 7. Recordings from this show are often misidentified as coming from solo Springsteen shows at Max's Kansas City in mid-1972.

The above-mentioned setlists are culled from circulating soundboard recordings of both shows from this night. The early show is believed to be complete but the band segment of the second show is missing. The recording of “Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)” (available on the boot CD 'Deep Down In The Vaults') is often claimed to be from one of the Max's Kansas City shows, but is actually from June 6, 1973 at Philadelphia's Spectrum arena. King Biscuit Flower Hour still retains a master tape of the entire January 31 show in its archives. There are conflicting reports as to whether the company also has any of the band segment of the second show. On their master tape reel "Saga Of The Architect Angel" is mistakenly titled "John Wayne". The company has repeatedly sought (and been declined) permission to commercially release what they have as part of its ongoing archive CD reissue series. Fortunately, we do have the material via the unofficial route. Recently, the show has been made available on Wolfgang's Vault, in much clearer quality than previously known. There are no additional tracks however.

The entire performance from the early show can be found in excellent quality on the CD boot 'Live At Max's Kansas City' (Swingin' Pig). This CD also has the two tracks from the second show but, inexplicably, the recording of "Song For Orphans" is only half complete on this boot. This audio can also be found on CD 'Tallent & Federici' (Vintage Masters). The complete recording of "Song For Orphans" from this show can be either found on the CDs 'The Unsurpassed Springsteen Vol 1' or 'The Unsurpassed Springsteen Vol 2'. Mike Appel also utilized these recordings of “Bishop Danced” and “Thundercrack” for copyright/publishing purposes. In doing so the long, 11:30 recording of "Thundercrack" was professionally edited to a slicker, more focused 6:50 running time. The song is cut in a couple of places, with the major edit completely eliminating the middle 'comedy break' routine. It is this edited version that was distributed (on tape or acetate) to select industry people during the period. This edited version of "Thundercrack" was one of the earliest booted Springsteen recordings and can be found on the mid-70s LP boot 'Fire On The Fingertips'. Enhanced sound specimens of this long-circulating edited version of "Thundercrack" can be found in more recent times on CD boots 'Forgotten Songs', 'Unsurpassed Springsteen Vol 2' and 'Deep Down In The Vaults' (which falsely credits the performance as January 5, 1974 at Joe's Place). The 2008 CD 'Max's Kansas City Night' (Crystal Cat) has all the above-mentioned songs plus "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" from June 6, 1973 at the Spectrum in Philadelphia. One final point of interest, a 1972 studio demo of "Vibes Man" with audience applause crudely dubbed onto it by a 1970s bootlegger often circulates identified as from this show. There is no genuine live performance of "Vibes Man" known.

1973-02-01 - MAX'S KANSAS CITY, NEW YORK CITY, NY

No set details known. Two shows, double bill, with Springsteen and band opening for headliner Biff Rose. In the February 17, 1973 issue of Billboard magazine, a review by Jim Melanson included mention of five songs performed at one of the Max's Kansas City shows. These are "Mary Queen Of Arkansas", "The Angel", "Spirit In The Night", "Growin' Up" and "Blinded By The Light". Brucebase has placed this information here, but they could have been played at any of the twelve shows in the stand other than the first two on January 31.
00News-32.png

1973-02-02 - MAX'S KANSAS CITY, NEW YORK CITY, NY

No set details known. Two shows, with Bruce and the boys opening for headliner Biff Rose. Although long-rumored to have been played during the stint at Paul's Mall in January, the only verified live performance of "Visitation At Fort Horn" stems from a show during this week-long residency at Max's, although the specific night has yet to be determined. During an interview with Charles Cross in 1990, Mike Appel commented on the performance "I was sitting in Max's Kansas City and Bruce decided to do it that night. He used Clarence, Vini and Garry as these 'Sons Of The Pioneers' type singers. I was with this guy from Epic (Records) and he turned to me and said, "I just don't believe this guy. This is the greatest thing I've ever heard".

Unfortunately no audio recording is known.

1973-02-03 - MAX'S KANSAS CITY, NEW YORK CITY, NY

Two shows. Due to Springsteen’s crowd popularity during the previous few nights the performing schedule was altered for this night and the following two nights, Springsteen and band opened, Biff Rose played next (one show only) and then Springsteen and band played a headliner length second show to close the evening’s festivities.

No known audio.

1973-02-05 - MAX'S KANSAS CITY, NEW YORK CITY, NY

No set details known. As had been the case the previous two nights the performing schedule was altered, with Springsteen and band opening, Biff Rose playing next and then Springsteen playing a headliner length second show to close the evening’s festivities. David Bowie showed up on this final night to see Biff Rose (a friend of Bowie's) and caught Springsteen's performance, although the two weren't introduced to each other. Bowie had never even heard of a guy named ‘Springsteen’ until this night. In a Musician Magazine interview in 1987 Bowie commented on Bruce’s performance on this night: "I hated him as a solo... as soon as the band came on it was like a different person and he was marvellous... I like the Greetings From Asbury Park material, my favorite period of Springsteen is the early stuff".

In June 1973 Bowie would be the first artist to record (though not release) a Springsteen composition ("Growin' Up"). Bowie and Bruce would finally be introduced in late 1974 (see the November 25, 1974 listing).

1973-02-10 - SUNSHINE IN, ASBURY PARK, NJ

TOKYO / SANTA ANA

Set details unknown. One show, with Bruce and the boys headlining and Elephant's Memory (John Lennon's occasional backing band) the evening's opener. A contributor to the Greasy Lake website recalls that "Tokyo" and "Santa Ana" were played. If correct, this would be the earliest known date that "Tokyo" was performed, by more than two months. Bruce's farewell appearance at this legendary haunt, the site of so many of his performances during the pre-CBS years. The Sunshine In closed down in 1977 and the location was converted into a parking lot a few years later.

1973-02-11 - BISHOP DOUGHERTY STUDENT CENTER, SETON HALL UNIVERSITY, SOUTH ORANGE, NJ

BLINDED BY THE LIGHT / TWIST AND SHOUT

No other setlist details known. One show, with Bruce and the boys the sole act on the bill. Held in the Main Lounge of the Bishop Dougherty Student Center.

Audio of the two songs above is held in private hands and has been offered for sale, but does not circulate. A description of a reel-to-reel tape for sale on Craiglist reads:

The concert was recorded with a Crown reel to reel 800 series tape recorder on Scotch tape thru a 20 channel Tascam board, coupled with vocals and instruments having their own Sennheiser, Neumann, and Shure microphones. As the story goes two-thirds into the show Bruce's manager saw we were recording the concert and demanded that we STOP recording and erase the tape! We obliged, but accidentally not all was destroyed; two songs Blinded by the Light and Twist and Shout with some Jive talk by Bruce addressed to the audience were not eradicated.

1973-02-14 - NEW GYMNASIUM, VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY, RICHMOND, VA

LOST IN THE FLOOD / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / 634-5789 (SOULSVILLE, U.S.A.) / MARY QUEEN OF ARKANSAS (5:12) / FOR YOU (4:58) / DOES THIS BUS STOP AT 82ND STREET? (5:02) / BLINDED BY THE LIGHT / THUNDERCRACK (12:20) / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) - FUN FUN FUN (12:45)

One show, double bill, with Bruce and the boys opening for headliner Dan Hicks & His Hot Licks. Springsteen was allowed to present a headliner-length performance of nearly 90 minutes, and he stole the show from Hicks. The above-mentioned setlist represents Springsteen's entire song presentation from this show in the correct sequence, as sourced from a newspaper review of the show in conjunction with a circulating (but very poor quality) 45-minute audience tape encompassing five of the show’s nine songs. The taper apparently did not record Bruce’s opening three numbers or "Blinded By The Light".

"For You" is the full band version, with an unusual piano introduction. From a historical standpoint the most significant performance, however, is "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)". This the earliest known performance and a unique arrangement that not only features a near-complete rendition of The Beach Boys "Fun Fun Fun" sandwiched in the middle, but also incorporates a cosmic story-rap that finds an eight-year-old Springsteen locked in an Alabama jail with Dennis Wilson, James Brown and Wilson Pickett (whose "634-5789 (Soulsville, U.S.A.)" Bruce covered earlier in the show). The subtle audio edit heard after "Thundercrack" (the end of the main set) and before "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" (the encore) merely eliminates several minutes of cheering as the audience coaxes Bruce and the band back for a final song. Following "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)", the emcee can be heard announcing that Dan Hicks & His Hot Licks will follow.

1973-02-22 - SANTA CLARA COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS, SAN JOSE, CA

Cancelled concert, never rescheduled.The gig was advertised in the February 16, 20 and 21 issues of the Stanford Daily, Springsteen was third on the bill after Butterfield and blues guitarist and singer Freddie King. It is Albee Tellone's belief that the newspaper adverts were printed by mistake since this show was never on their itinerary. In all likelihood, it was cancelled before the band left New Jersey.

1973-02-24 - CIVIC THEATER, SAN DIEGO, CA

Cancelled concert, never rescheduled. San Diego was supposed to be the start of a pre-planned, two-week series of west coast gigs featuring the then-unknown Springsteen opening for mid-'60s electric blues legend Paul Butterfield’s new outfit Paul Butterfield's Better Days. Bruce and the band flew out to Los Angeles only to be informed upon arrival that nearly all of the scheduled dates with Butterfield were in the process of being cancelled due to very poor advanced ticket sales. Bruce’s road crew, on the other hand, did not fly out with the band, they drove out to the west coast with all the band’s sound equipment. Greetings Tour sound manager Albee Tellone has commented that the road crew drove directly to San Diego only to learn upon arrival that the gig had been axed. The road crew then drove to LA to meet up with the band. With the Paul Butterfield Tour in tatters, only one show with Butterfield ended up being played (see February 28 listing). Bruce’s agent scurried around and was able to slot him onto the billing of a couple of Blood, Sweat and Tears shows.

1973-02-26 - THE TROUBADOUR, WEST HOLLYWOOD, CA

MARY QUEEN OF ARKANSAS / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / LOST IN THE FLOOD / FOR YOU

One show, double bill, with Springsteen and band opening for Pan (a just-formed band headed by former Beau Brummels guitarist/songwriter Ron Elliot). Springsteen's first west coast show. For the occasion Columbia sent out postcard invitations to the gig - click the link above to view one of these cards. This was actually 'hoot night' at the club, but some of the LA music press were present to listen to the much-respected Elliot’s new outfit. A couple of songs into the six-song set Bruce’s guitar amp failed and, because minimal spares had been brought out to the west coast, the road crew were unable to fix it, so Bruce performed most of this show on piano instead of electric guitar. This was the same amp that had been fried at the November 25, 1972 show in Detroit. The four above-mentioned tracks were played but these represent only a partial setlist from this show. Springsteen’s performance received brief (but positive) reviews by Billboard’s Nat Freeland and LA Free Press journalist Peter Jay Philbin. Of the performance the LA Free Press said "It was Bruce Springsteen who made the crowd collision, the stepped on toes, the smoke-pained eyeballs, the walk away from the TV set all worthwhile...never have I been more impressed with a debuting singer than I was with Bruce Springsteen on Monday night." Also in the audience to watch Bruce was soul singer Jerry Butler, who was about to begin a six-night stint at the club, starting the following evening.

There is no circulating audio of this show.

1973-03-02 - BERKELEY COMMUNITY THEATRE, BERKELEY, CA

LOST IN THE FLOOD (start cut, 4.57) / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT (4.58) / WILD BILLY'S CIRCUS STORY (4.48) / BISHOP DANCED (4.01) / DOES THIS BUS STOP AT 82ND STREET? (5.13) / BLINDED BY THE LIGHT (5.30) / THUNDERCRACK (10.43)

One show, 8.00pm, double bill, with Springsteen and band opening for headliners Blood, Sweat & Tears. Ironically Bill Graham, who'd nearly signed Bruce/Steel Mill three years earlier, organised this concert.

The above-mentioned setlist derives from an excellent quality soundboard recording that began circulating in the mid-1990s. Given Bruce's restricted performing time as the opening act, the circulating audio is likely to represent the complete performance. The circulating audio is missing the opening seconds of "Lost In The Flood" and concludes with a series of announcements. Available on the CDs 'Prodigal Son' (Crystal Cat), 'Before The Flood' (CU) and in improved quality 'On The Road Night' (Crystal Cat).

1973-03-03 - SANTA MONICA CIVIC AUDITORIUM, SANTA MONICA, CA

LOST IN THE FLOOD

No more set details known. One show, double bill, with Springsteen and band opening for headliners Blood, Sweat & Tears. Bruce and the boys were allowed to play nearly a headliner-length set at this show. A contributor to the Greasy Lake website notes that "Lost In The Flood" was played solo on piano: "I remember 'Lost In The Flood" because we had just heard on the news at the motel that there was an agreement made at the Paris Peace Talks to end the war in Vietnam that we were all opposed to. Bruce made a specific dedication of "Lost In The Flood" to the guys who made it back from 'Nam."

Following this show Blood, Sweat and Tears flew to Colorado for a three-night residency (March 4 to 6) at a nightclub in Boulder called Tulagi. Although the possibility of Bruce joining them for this residency at Tulagi may have been discussed, it definitely never eventuated. A day or two following this Santa Monica show Bruce and the band flew back to New Jersey, with Bruce’s road crew driving back and arriving a few days later.

1973-03-12 - OLIVER'S, BOSTON, MA

No setlist details known. One show, with Springsteen and band the sole act on the bill. This was the opening night of a week-long, seven-show residency at the small, 400 seat Boston club. The performances during this residency at Oliver’s were significant, as not only was this Bruce’s first headlining club residency since Kenny’s Castaways in late 1972 but, unlike Castaways, these were one-show-per-night gigs that enabled Springsteen to stretch out the performances to two hours or longer each night. In addition, there was a fanatical pre-1973 fan base of New Jersey shore region kids living in Boston and attending the city’s many universities, so the Oliver’s shows were sold-out and overflowing with many of the same people every night. Springsteen responded by dramatically altering the setlist each evening and performing new or infrequently played material (both covers and originals). Greetings Tour sound manager Albee Tellone, who rates the March gigs at Oliver’s as among the finest of all the 1973 shows has commented “after the disappointments we encountered on the west coast leg, it was incredible to arrive back and get this amazing reception in Boston. It was a fantastic homecoming, so to speak”.

There is (frustratingly) no known audio from this week.

1973-03-13 - OLIVER'S, BOSTON, MA

APACHE / RING OF FIRE

No set details known. One show, with Springsteen and band the sole act on the bill. The show was about two hours in length, with a short intermission half way through. Two cover songs were introduced into the live repertoire during the Oliver’s residency, the surf instrumental “Apache” and Johnny Cash’s “Ring Of Fire”. Both were only performed sporadically throughout the remainder of 1973. Greetings Tour Sound Manager Albee Tellone comments: “When we got back from the ill-fated California trip Bruce bought himself an Echoplex that he used for guitar effects. I had to set it up for him each night. The reason he started performing “Apache” was because he could reproduce the exact sound of the original record”.

Albee has noted that this was not a one-off performance of “The Fever”, it was played at several other gigs during the late March-May, 1973 period, but eventually dropped in favour of new compositions emerging from the second album sessions.

The two above-mentioned tracks (with Bruce on piano on both) are mentioned in a brief newspaper review of the show. This show was scheduled to begin at 8:30pm but was delayed about an hour by the late arrival and set up of the Springsteen camp following an early afternoon show at Oliver's in Boston.

1973-03-24 - STUDENT CENTER, NIAGARA UNIVERSITY, LEWISTON, NY

THUNDERCRACK / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) - FUN FUN FUN / TWIST AND SHOUT

One show, double bill, with Bruce and the boys headlining and local country-rock group Old Salt opening. Held indoors in the 350-seat Student Center. The show was not a sellout, with a reported 300 tickets sold. Given Springsteen was a virtual unknown at the time, this gig at Niagara received an unprecedented amount of pre and post concert press coverage in the school's modest campus newspaper, all articles written by students. The student who orchestrated this event (Kerry McNamara) was obviously a serious Bruce fan. A student reporter even seems to have travelled south to get a brief but fascinating interview with Bruce a couple of weeks before this show. In this interview Bruce mentions he is now playing "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight) - Fun, Fun, Fun" as a special encore (a tape exists of it from February 14 at VCU). In addition Bruce mentions "Ring Of Fire" and the instrumental "Apache" as two cover songs he's been incorporating into his recent shows. Interestingly it is also revealed that this gig had originally been planned for March 2 but had been rescheduled to March 24 because of the West Coast tour with Paul Butterfield's Better Days.

This seems to have been an intimate, inspired crowd that elicited an equally inspired performance. Bruce even donned his legendary Elvis t-shirt at this show (see photo above), a guarantee of a special evening! After Old Salt opened with a 60-minute set, Springsteen performed a 120-minute show with no intermission, including a triple encore. As reported in the reviews of the show that followed, Bruce opened with two (unnamed in print) acoustic numbers (accompanied by Clarence on the first and Danny on the second) and them brought out the entire band. The final song in the main set was "Thundercrack". The first encore was "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight) - Fun Fun Fun" and the second encore was "Twist And Shout". The title of the third encore is not mentioned. This is the longest verified Band performance up to this point and one of the very few two-hour shows Bruce did in 1973.

A contributor to the Greasy Lake website writes: "The ticket was $1.00 and about 150 - 200 kids showed up but the band played like there were 10,000. Bruce was wearing a newsboy cap and he was all over the place. Thin, full beard, leather jacket and a tee shirt. He exploded right in front of us. I had never seen anything like him or the band. I think they played about three hours. I was physically exhausted and can only imagine how Bruce and the Band felt. I remember some of their early songs and I also remember "Devil with the Blue Dress On". I think they played "Come Together" by the Beatles too. When it was over, we were exhausted. I went to breakfast late that night at a diner and there they were. I said hello, told them how great the show was and made small talk. Bruce could not have been nicer. Clarence too. A few months later they came back to NU and there were probably 1000 people there."

Unfortunately, no audio is circulating from this show.

Bruce and the boys (performing a 60-minute set) opened for headliner Stevie Wonder, who performed a two-hour show. Although not mentioned in pre-concert advertisements, a local group called Surviving Hearts began the evening's festivities with a 45-minute set.

1973-04-01 - THE LEDGE, RUTGERS UNIVERSITY, NEW BRUNSWICK, NJ

Set details unknown. One five-hour, triple bill show, with Bruce and the boys headlining. The undercard bands were Heavy Trucking (first up with a 60-minute set) and Southern Conspiracy (who played an 80-minute set). Although held indoors at the ever-popular Ledge Club, the show was delayed for about an hour due to moisture from rainy weather outside affecting the electrics. According to a newspaper review Bruce opened the show with one acoustic song and immediately brought on the band, and played for over 90 minutes. The review also mentions that the band include tuba and accordion players, which perhaps suggests that "Wild Billy's Circus Story" and "4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)" were included in the set.

1973-04-07 - NORFOLK SCOPE, NORFOLK, VA

No set details known. One show, double bill, with Springsteen and band opening for headliner The Beach Boys (minus Brian Wilson, who wasn’t touring with the group at the time). As the evening's undercard, Bruce's performance was likely to have been limited to around 70 minutes.

1973-04-11 - OMNI COLISEUM, ATLANTA, GA

No set details known. One show, triple billing, with Bruce and the boys opening for The Beach Boys. The poster (see above) has Springsteen billed third but, given the documented artist fee payments for this show, it is almost certain that Mother's Finest opened the show and Springsteen followed. Springsteen's set is likely to have been about 60 minutes. This concert took place at a time when The Beach Boys were at a very low ebb in popularity in America and this show proved a financial disaster for the promoter, as less than 3,000 tickets were sold. The Omni Coliseum held 16,000.

1973-04-13 - VILLANOVA FIELD HOUSE, VILLANOVA UNIVERSITY, VILLANOVA, PA

Cancelled, never rescheduled. This show, which was to be held in the Villanova Field House, was billed as the 'Villanova Senior Concert' and was to feature Springsteen as headliner and Philadelphia locals Daryl Hall & John Oates as the support act. Bruce cancelled at the last minute, with the announcement of the concert's demise made on April 11 in the school's newspaper.

1973-04-18 - GYMNASIUM, CHRISTIAN BROTHERS ACADEMY, LINCROFT, NJ

BLINDED BY THE LIGHT

No more setlist details known. One show, double bill, with Springsteen and band headlining and local horn-based rock outfit Satan's Jury opening. Held in the CBA gymnasium. A contributor to Greasy Lake recalls "Blinded By The Light" was played. Another recalls the following: "Three things I remember about this show... First was hearing him be introduced as "Columbia recording artist Bruce Springsteen" Second was the way he led into "Blinded By The Light" saying "This is the single off our album which has already flopped!" And third, he did what he called a high school fade out, where he and the band actually faded the end of a song live. It was funny and also very well done. He did have his entire band there with him and I believe Tinker did the sound. It was a fun night!" This show included a special guest appearance on congas by Richard Blackwell, a couple of months later Blackwell provided the conga backing on the officially issued studio version of "New York City Serenade". This is one of only two known appearances by Springsteen and the Band at a high school venue (the other was a benefit at Choate School on April 10, 1976). Photographs of the show are in the CBA Pegasus 1973 Yearbook.

1973-04-23 - SHABOO, WILLIMANTIC, CT

Cancelled (due to a scheduling conflict that developed with another gig on the same night), never rescheduled. Originally planned as one show, with Springsteen and the band the sole act on the bill. Shaboo was a small club that catered for students at nearby Eastern Connecticut University. Shaboo’s owner/manager David Foster confirmed in a 2000 interview in the Hartford Courant that Bruce cancelled this appearance as well as a December 16 scheduled appearance. Said Foster, “I would like to say that I had Springsteen at the club, but it just wasn’t to be... but I still have the contracts”.

1973-04-23 - BUSHNELL MEMORIAL HALL, HARTFORD, CT

4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY)

No other set details known. One show, double bill, with Springsteen opening for headliner Richie Havens. Springsteen and the boys were able to give an extended 70-80 minute performance even though they were the opener. This gig was originally intended for another night and when the date was moved it forced Springsteen to cancel a scheduled show at the Shaboo club in nearby Willimantic. "4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)" opened the set - this is the earliest known performance of the song. Brucebase reader Ed was present, and says... "I know Bruce opened with "4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)", but the rest of the show is just a blur. No one in the audience had ever heard Bruce before, and the crowd loved him! He ended up doing about 45 minutes of encores, and finally had to leave the stage so Richie Havens could perform. Throughout the Richie Havens show people kept calling for Bruce!"

1973-04-24 - THE MAIN POINT, BRYN MAWR, PA

Early (first) Show: NEW YORK SONG (5.14) / WILD BILLY'S CIRCUS STORY (4.58) / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT (5.02) / DOES THIS BUS STOP AT 82ND STREET? (4.30) / SANTA ANA (5.12) / TOKYO (7.03) / THUNDERCRACK (13.23)

Two shows, 8.00pm and 10.00pm, double billing, with Springsteen and band headlining and folk duo Aztec Two-Step opening. This was Springsteen's first real time concert venue simulcast, courtesy of Philadelphia's WMMR-FM.

Only the early show was broadcast and the above-mentioned setlist represents that complete performance. There is no circulating audio from the late show, which would have lasted 20 - 30 minutes longer. Available in excellent quality on the CDs 'Thundercrack' (Great Dane), 'And The Band Played' (Lobster) and 'Small Town Boy' (Swingin' Pig). Also commercially released as 'Bound For Glory' in the UK by Left Field Media. This CD includes the January 9 radio broadcast from Boston. This show represents the earliest known recordings of "Santa Ana" and "Tokyo". Last known version of "Wild Billy's Circus Story" to include the "hear the liars" lyric.

1973-04-26 - UNIVERSITY OF BRIDGEPORT, BRIDGEPORT, CT

No details known. This is an unconfirmed show - an advertisement in the 'Campus Dates' section of Billboard magazine lists this date but it is unknown whether the concert ever took place. It's unlikely - Albee Tellone (roadie at the time) doesn't recall ever playing at the University of Bridgeport. A second date at the University was scheduled for October 19, which was cancelled - instead Springsteen performed at Oliver's in Boston.
00Photo-32.png

1973-04-27 - CONVOCATION CENTER, OHIO UNIVERSITY, ATHENS, OH

Set details unknown. A fairly impressive nine-artist roster with Bruce and the band receiving near bottom billing. They play early on the first day of this two day music festival held indoors at the school's Convocation Center. The Eagles co-headline. Eagle Don Henley has commented on this show: "I'd first heard about Springsteen from Jackson (Browne), who raved about him. Then we ended up on the same bill as Bruce at a festival out in Ohio. So I sort of wandered in alone and checked out his set. He was just a warm-up act at that this show. After watching him I remember thinking to myself that this was a guy that wasn't gonna be warming up the crowd for us, or for anybody, for very long".

1973-04-28 - CHANCES R, CHAMPAIGN, IL

Cancelled Springsteen performance, although the show almost certainly went ahead without Bruce. This was originally scheduled as one sixty-minute show starting at 10.30pm, double bill, with Springsteen and band headlining and local group Zacharia performing both before and after Bruce's set. Show was sponsored by WPGU-FM, the student radio station of the University Of Illinois. The radio station was also scheduled to broadcast Bruce's set live. Chances R was a legendary '60s/'70s rock club on Chester Ave in Champaign that catered for students at the nearby university. This gig had originally been booked as a convenient flow-on from Bruce’s nearby Ohio University gig the previous day. However following this booking Mike Appel was able to get Bruce a performance slot at the infinitely more prestigious Chuck Berry / Jerry Lee Lewis concert in Maryland (see the following listing). It's likely that following the cancellation the show was rescheduled to May 1.
00Photo-32.png00News-32.png

1973-04-28 - COLE FIELD HOUSE, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK, MD

SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / DOES THIS BUS STOP AT 82ND STREET? / BLINDED BY THE LIGHT / THUNDERCRACK

As Chuck Berry's backing band: MAYBELLENE / ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC / SCHOOL DAY (RING! RING! GOES THE BELL) / ROLL OVER BEETHOVEN / NADINE (IS IT YOU?) / NO PARTICULAR PLACE TO GO / SWEET LITTLE SIXTEEN / MY DING-A-LING / REELIN' AND ROCKIN' / JOHNNY B GOODE

One show, triple bill, with Chuck Berry headlining, Jerry Lee Lewis second billed and Bruce and the boys opening. A show now steeped in legend. Berry's contract stipulated that it was the promoter's responsibility to supply him with a backing band for this concert. Apparently Bruce learned about a week before the show that the promoter was seeking a group to support Berry and immediately volunteered his band's services for free, which the promoter gladly accepted. There was no rehearsal or soundcheck with Berry, so Bruce and the boys improvised as best they could.

Bruce and the boys opened their part of the show with a 50-minute set, followed by a 60-minute set by Jerry Lee Lewis and his band. Chuck Berry (with Springsteen's entire band backing him, including Bruce and Southside Johnny) closed the evening's festivities with a 70-minute performance. Springsteen recounts some hilarious details in the 1987 Chuck Berry documentary Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll, but does not mention Southside Johnny’s appearance. Fearing that Berry might not want a harp player Bruce positioned Southside in the shadows at the extreme end of the stage. However Berry enjoyed the harp playing and near the end of the show he actually acknowledged Southside to the crowd saying “that white boy can blow, can’t he!"

The above-mentioned setlist represents most, if not all, of the performances from both Springsteen's opening slot and from the Chuck Berry performance. This almost sold out gig in the 15,000 seat Cole Field House was not without some controversy. Such was the demand to see the show that the school newspaper reported that twenty people were arrested when police spotted individuals sneaking into the concert via an open female lavatory window at the back of the building. Apparently 200-300 people made it in before the police caught wind of what was going on.

Sadly there is no known audio of this show.

1973-04-29 - REC HALL, PENN STATE UNIVERSITY, UNIVERSITY PARK, PA

Cancelled Springsteen performance, although this concert by headliner Frank Zappa & The Mothers took place, as scheduled.

There’s a complicated background story to this cancellation by Bruce. This show was originally supposed to feature Zappa & The Mothers headlining and one of CBS’s hot acts, The Mahavishnu Orchestra, opening. However the Mahavishnu Orchestra (who at the time were taking part in a mini-tour leg opening Zappa’s gigs) had to pull out of this show to play the Columbia Records 'Week To Remember' concert series in Los Angeles (Mahavishnu actually headlined in L.A. on April 29). When Mahavishnu withdrew it appears that Springsteen was initially substituted to open for Zappa. However Springsteen was then, soon after, also put on the itinerary for the 'Week To Remember' series in L.A. (Bruce played as an undercard at the May 1 show). Consequently manager Mike Appel (who notes a Penn State gig in his tour manifest) pulled Bruce out of this gig as well. Zappa & The Mothers ended up playing with no other artist on the bill. All of the above changes took place before any ads for the show were placed or tickets sold, so the public were not aware or expecting any opening act for Zappa at Penn State. As it turned out the Mahavishnu Orchestra was back opening for Zappa at his next show (May 1 at Kent State) and for the remaining block of shows on this sub-leg of Zappa’s tour.

1973-05-01 - CHANCES R, CHAMPAIGN, IL

Cancelled Springsteen performance, although the show went ahead with Wilderness Road in Springsteen's stead. The concert was sponsored by WPGU-FM, the student radio station of the University Of Illinois. It's likely that this date was scheduled after the April 28 show was cancelled, although the same fate befell tonight's show when Springsteen was signed to play at CBS's 'Week To Remember' concert series in Los Angeles.

1973-05-01 - AHMANSON THEATRE, LOS ANGELES, CA

SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / WILD BILLY'S CIRCUS STORY / TOKYO / DOES THIS BUS STOP AT 82ND STREET? / THUNDERCRACK / TWIST AND SHOUT

Partial setlist known. One show, triple bill, held in the sold out 2,000 seat Ahmanson Theatre, with Springsteen and band opening for Dr. Hook & The Medicine Show and headliner New Riders of the Purple Sage. This concert is often confused with the private CBS Sales Convention show (see July 27 for details). However the Ahmanson Theatre show was a normal, public admission event, but incorporating an unusual format. Organized and promoted by CBS as 'A Week To Remember', seven consecutive nightly shows, each show featuring three different CBS artists. Bruce and the band flew to L.A. on April 30, stayed at the Hilton hotel, performed on May 1 and returned east on May 3. Springsteen's set was received well in the May 19, 1973 issue of Billboard, which said "If any one artist captured the essence of what the week was really all about it was Bruce Springsteen. [He] has an appeal that borders on the universal. His songs are interesting, thoughtfully worked out and often exciting. Material aside, he has about him that glow, the elusive X factor that spells STAR. Comparisons to Van Morrison and Bob Dylan have been made but he is no carbon, rather a glowing and vibrant performer in his own right".

An audio recording of "Wild Billy's Circus Story" from this show was issued promotionally by CBS on July 7, 1973 as part of its Playback EP series, as "Circus Song". Also found on the EP are songs by Albert Hammond, Loudon Wainright III, and Taj Mahal. The remainder of the audio from this show does not circulate, except for the "Spirit In The Night" and "Thundercrack" which accompany their corresponding video recordings. All seven shows in the Ahmanson series were filmed in color by Arnold Levine Productions on behalf of CBS, whose intention was to have material to show to reps at the CBS Sales Convention in July. This happened, Bruce's complete performance was shown several times at the Convention, but has never been shown anywhere since. It remains in CBS's vault. Brief snippets of "Wild Billy's Circus Story" and "Thundercrack" were used in mid-1974 as part of a promo-only video clip created by CBS to promote the second album. This clip readily circulates and, indeed, was shown in the VH-1 Rockumentary. The frustratingly brief film excerpt of Springsteen performing "Spirit In The Night" on piano that was shown in the 1998 Bruce Springsteen: A Secret History BBC Documentary is from this show. "Tokyo" was preceded by the Ducky Slattery monologue and at the conclusion of "Thundercrack" a giant Garden State Parkway sign descended from the ceiling, the only time this prop was ever utilized (see photo). "Twist And Shout" was the encore. Three songs from this appearance (“Spirit In The Night”, “Wild Billy's Circus Story” and “Thundercrack”) were officially released as (elaborately restored) bonus footage on the Wings For Wheels documentary DVD in 2005. However, "Thundercrack" is incomplete and cuts at just over ten minutes. An hour of raw footage from this show is now among collectors, featuring multiple versions of the three promotional tracks, each shot from a different camera angle. On this video you can also hear a brief snippet of the introduction to "Does This Bus Stop At 82nd Street?".

1973-05-05 - ALUMNI HALL, PROVIDENCE COLLEGE, PROVIDENCE, RI

No set details known. One show, double bill, held in the 2,500 seat Alumni Hall, with Springsteen and band headlining and local singer-songwriter John Paul Jones (not Led Zeppelin's bassist) opening. A more than 90-minute performance by Bruce.
00Photo-32.png

1973-05-06 - ALUMNI STADIUM, UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS, AMHERST, MA

No set details known. One show, triple-bill, with Springsteen and band the show opener. Second on the bill was Cold Blood and the headliner was It's A Beautiful Day. Springsteen was a very late replacement for The Elvin Bishop Group, who cancelled the week before. This was an all-afternoon, outdoor extravaganza held in the University's expansive 30,000 seat Alumni Stadium as part of 'Spring Carnival' week. The weather was unseasonably cool, overcast and blustery, so the attendance was only about 18,000, still, it was the biggest venue and one of the largest audiences Bruce played during the 1970s. All three bands played about 90-minute sets. Click the link above to view photographs of the event from the UMass yearbook, as well as press coverage.

1973-05-11 - VETERANS MEMORIAL AUDITORIUM, COLUMBUS, OH

No set details known. One show with Bruce and the boys opening for headliner Richie Havens. Held inside the fairly large Veterans Memorial Auditorium. There were more than a few empty seats at this concert, according to reports. Given Bruce was the gig opener this is likely to have been a 60-75 minute performance.

1973-05-12 - BEHIND THE EAST GYM, NIAGARA UNIVERSITY, LEWISTON, NY

No set details known. One five-hour quadruple billing outdoor extravaganza, with Springsteen headlining. Support acts (in order of appearance) were acoustic guitarist Alan Brawer, county-rock band Old Salt and singer/songwriter Jimmy Spheeris (who would open for Bruce at Liberty Hall in Houston in 1974). This was a free concert, subsidized by the University, celebrating the closing of the school for summer recess. A 'Twilight' show, held behind the East Gym, with the three undercard acts playing 40 - 70-minute sets and Bruce and the boys finishing under the stars with an 100-minute show. A 'by demand' return engagement following Bruce's memorable gig at Niagara seven weeks earlier (see March 24 listing).

1973-05-16 - MINNESOTA STATE UNIVERSITY, MANKATO, MN

Cancelled Springsteen performance (due to last-minute studio session commitments), never rescheduled, although this multi-artist, all-day Spring Carnival festival held behind the Centennial Student Union went ahead as planned without the second billed Springsteen.

1973-05-18 - MICHIGAN TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY, HOUGHTON, MI

A date at Michigan Tech was advertised in Billboard Magazine during May 1973, but we have no record of a show ever taking place. The assumption is the date was cancelled due to studio session commitments in the same fashion as the show two days previous, but that is unconfirmed at this time. Considering that at the time Bruce and the band were driving to gigs, it seems peculiar to schedule a show so far north. Albee Tellone comments that they'd have to have more than one gig to justify the journey. It's possible that other dates were scheduled in the general area, but were all cancelled.

1973-05-24 - CHILDE HAROLD, WASHINGTON, DC

No set details known. One show, with Springsteen and band the sole act on the bill. A two-hour performance that involved three 40-minute sets with an intermission between each. A large contingent of longtime Springsteen fans from nearby Richmond came to these shows, catching Childe Harold's management completely by surprise. According to club owner Bill Timberlake there were lines two blocks long each night and he had to go outside and tell people there was no room to fit them. These three shows at Childe Harold are believed to have included the unofficial debut of David Sancious in the band, a situation seemingly corroborated by critic Bob Gould's description of the Childe Harold line-up, which he describes as including both a piano player and an organ player (not including Bruce).. Sancious made his 'formal' debut on June 22. The venue, a cozy, wood-lined saloon that played host to many famous acts, closed in 2007. According to a news article, the owner broiled steaks for Springsteen between sets. For his three nights work, Bruce took home $750.

1973-05-30 - CUMBERLAND COUNTY MEMORIAL ARENA, FAYETTEVILLE, NC

No set details known. One show, double bill, with Bruce and the boys opening for headlining band Chicago. This is the first of thirteen consecutive shows in which Springsteen opened for Chicago. Large impersonal auditoriums, a very M.O.R. headlining act whose fans had no affinity with Bruce's music and an inflexible 40-minute performing time allocation - these all combined to make this Chicago mini-tour, in Bruce's words "a soul destroying experience". Mike Appel has stated that Bruce did not open any of the Chicago shows with his usual acoustic spotlight solo, as he'd been doing religiously since the start of the Greetings Tour.

1973-05-31 - ALPHA SOUND STUDIOS, RICHMOND, VA

SATIN DOLL (1.10) / DOES THIS BUS STOP AT 82ND STREET? (4.54) / WILD BILLY'S CIRCUS STORY (4.58) / GROWIN’ UP (3.18) / NEW YORK SONG (5.34) / YOU MEAN SO MUCH TO ME (6:39)

Bruce’s second known radio show, but this one is unusual because it took place at Richmond’s Alpha Sound Studios, not at the station itself. It was broadcast live by WGOE-FM via a remote link. In addition to the DJ the small audience heard in the studio included Mike Appel, Jim Cretecos, Albee Tellone and David Sancious (who had yet to join the band but who was employed at the studio at the time). Albee Tellone has recently commented that he does not believe he was in the audience, but setting up the equipment for the evening show at Richmond Coliseum. The above-mentioned six-song setlist is the complete performance. This performance (which features all the band in cameos except for Vini Lopez) is highlighted by what many consider the definitive available version of “You Mean So Much To Me”. During the show a fan calls into the radio station and requests Bruce’s old Steel Mill chestnut “Resurrection” but Bruce doesn’t play it. Interestingly as Bruce takes his seat to perform a song solo at the piano one of the entourage can be heard saying “Janey?”, apparently thinking Bruce was going to perform the recently composed “Janey Needs A Shooter” to which Bruce replies “no” and instead delivers a fine version of his then-new “New York Song”.

After the show Mike Appel took possession of the master tape, so none of the performance was ever re-broadcast by the station. Fortunately a fan taped the entire show from their radio, although the sound quality was weak. Although this audience audio had been in circulation since the mid-1970s it had never appeared on any mainstream bootleg, exception for the track “You Mean So Much To Me”, which first surfaced on the 1976 vinyl LP boot 'Resurrected' in poor quality. This later appeared in better quality on the CD 'Radio Waves' (Great Dane). The entire fan-recorded version is now available on a custom CDR boot entitled 'Strictly Prohibited'. A low generation copy of the entire original master tape (noted above) first surfaced (in very limited hands) in the early 1990s. Then the recording of the track "You Mean So Much To Me" from this source emerged on the 1998 boot ‘Deep Down In The Vaults' (E Street Records) and in 1999 on ‘Missing Tracks, Vol One' (Thrill Hill). The complete master tape in perfect sound quality finally emerged into the wider collector community in early 2007, and is available on CD 'On The Road Night' (Crystal Cat), tracks 8-13.

1973-05-31 - RICHMOND COLISEUM, RICHMOND, VA

NEW YORK SONG / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) / SANTA ANA / SECRET TO THE BLUES / TOKYO / THUNDERCRACK / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT)

One show, double bill, with Springsteen and band opening for headliners Chicago. The second of thirteen consecutive shows opening for them. The setlist above, sourced from a combination of attendee recollection and an audience recording, has been rearranged into a 'best guess" order, the lack of setlists from around this time makes it hard to be confident of the correct order. A review in the following days Richmond News Leader by Barbara Green read "Springsteen is a curious performer. Thin and pale and dressed in black, he looks like a parody of the early Bob Dylan. His voice is undistinguished, though it cannot be ignored in his songs, and his guitar playing is somewhere to the left of center of a bell curve. However, he has enough stage presence to catch one's eye, and his music is distinguished by an unusually good band with a fine rhythmic feeling and bounce and the ability to hold on tight to a song."

The above-mentioned seven-song setlist is culled from a weak quality four-song, 35-minute audience tape of the show that circulates among collectors and the recollection of an attendee. This potentially represents the complete performance, which lasted about 60 minutes. The audio ("Santa Ana", "Secret To The Blues", "Tokyo", and "Thundercrack") appears to capture the last half of Springsteen’s set, before the final encore of "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight). The audio of "Thundercrack" is incomplete, missing the last few minutes. From a historical standpoint the most interesting track here is "Secret To The Blues", one of only two circulating audio performances (and the better of the two).

1973-06-01 - HAMPTON ROADS COLISEUM, HAMPTON, VA

1973-06-02 - RADIO STATION WHFS-FM, BETHESDA, MD

SATIN DOLL / WILD BILLY'S CIRCUS STORY / NEW YORK SONG / GROWIN' UP / MARY QUEEN OF ARKANSAS

In-station interview conducted by Donald 'Cerphe' Colwell (a DJ who was one of Bruce’s biggest early supporters) plus Bruce’s third acoustic radio performance, joined by Danny Federici and Clarence Clemons. The above-mentioned five-song setlist is believed to be the complete show. This is Bruce’s last known in-station musical performance until March 9, 1974.

Radio Broadcast (Unbooted & Grethe). The master tape is not circulating but a fan had the foresight to tape the 25-minute show from the radio; various versions circulate ranging from fair to very good quality. Two of the tracks, "New York Song" and "Mary Queen Of Arkansas" can be found as tracks nine and ten on the CD ‘Radio Waves' (Great Dane). The entire audio is available on the custom made CDR boot ‘Strictly Prohibited' and 'We're On The Air' (misses the first 50 seconds) as well as a number of fan made transfers.

1973-06-02 - BALTIMORE CIVIC CENTER, BALTIMORE, MD

No set details known. One show, double bill, with Bruce and the boys opening for jazz drummer Billy Cobham and headliners Chicago. The fourth of thirteen consecutive shows. Bruce's performance was almost certainly restricted to a maximum of 45 minutes. Tickets were $2. Bruce recalled this concert during his next show in Baltimore - over 36 years later in 2009. What stayed in his mind was someone saying, "Hey, man, we didn't come here to see you." To which he replied, "Oh yeah? Well, the next time you do, it's gonna cost you five bucks." A ticket to his show in 2009 cost $98.

No set details known. One show, double bill, with Springsteen and band opening for Chicago. The fifth of thirteen consecutive shows. Springsteen’s performance was about 60 minutes and there were scattered boos heard from an audience that clearly weren't interested in any opening act and impatient to see the headliners.

1973-06-06 - SPECTRUM, PHILADELPHIA, PA

THE E STREET SHUFFLE / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT)

No other set details known. One show, double bill, with Bruce and the boys opening for headliners Chicago. The sixth of thirteen consecutive shows. “Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)” features the same early draft lyrics performed in Richmond on February 14. Bruce changed the words shortly after this date, and all later period live renditions feature the 'official' "mama's reins - little girl tongue" lyrics. Bruce's performance was almost certainly restricted to a maximum of 45 minutes but, on this night, there are reports he was on and off in 30 minutes, courtesy of a hostile crowd. Brucebase reader Chuck comments: "I was at the June 6 Spectrum concert when he was booed. It was the subject of conversation at two radio stations when I told them the story. I also told them that, when the crowd kept booing, Bruce just kept singing while waving his middle finger back and forth at the crowd. Even though I didn't like him at the concert, I became a big fan later and whenever I told anyone the story of Bruce being booed nobody believed me. I felt extremely embarrassed that night and felt bad for the group on stage. Bruce really did flip and wave the middle finger." Albee Tellone agreed that Bruce was booed at this venue and possibly another, noting that it mainly was from the crowd's impatience with waiting for Chicago to appear.

The above-mentioned studio-mixed live recording of “Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)” first surfaced on the three-CD set 'Deep Down In The Vaults' (E Street Records), but the source of the recording has long been subject to confusion. The audio characteristics were considered to be similar to recordings from Max's Kansas City in January 1973, so with no other references Brucebase had placed the recording there. However, information obtained from Clinton Heylin's book The E Street Shuffle has confirmed the recording actually comes from this date. "The E Street Shuffle" was also committed to tape, however that particular recording never made it into general circulation. These may have served as copyright reference recordings for Laurel Canyon, much the same as the recording of “Thundercrack” from January 31 did. It's obvious the audience is hearing “Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)” for the very first time, so it's fascinating to listen to the reaction. Given that this early rendition features just five instruments, it lacks the punch that David Sancious’s presence later injected in the arrangement. However this is currently the earliest high quality live recording of the song in circulation and it includes the “chiffon reins - samurai tongue” lines that grace Bruce's 1972 handwritten lyric sheet.

1973-06-07 - ONONDAGA COUNTY WAR MEMORIAL AUDITORIUM, SYRACUSE, NY

No set details known. One show, double bill, with Springsteen and band opening for Chicago. The seventh of thirteen consecutive shows. Springsteen was mis-identified in the local press, with the Syracuse Herald Journal describing the band as "a five-member combo from New Jersey called Bris Christy." If you have a scan or photo of this article (or any others from this show) please get in touch. The show was also advertised in the Arts section of the New York Times.

1973-06-08 - BOSTON GARDEN, BOSTON, MA

No set details known. One show, double bill, with Bruce and the boys opening for headliners Chicago. The eight of thirteen consecutive shows. Bruce's performance was almost certainly restricted to a maximum of 45 minutes. This report comes from the then-14-year-old Brad, who was present at one of the Boston Garden shows: "I was instantly mesmerized with Springsteen’s performance, but I had no idea who he was. The master of ceremonies introduced them as “The Bruce Springsteen Band,” but it was garbled and I could not clearly hear the "Springsteen" part. At this show, they definitely played "Spirit In the Night" (with the back n’ forth audience participation), and the only other song I clearly remember was "Growin’ Up" when Bruce played solo on piano. They might have played "Thundercrack," too, because it sounded oddly familiar six years later when I was collecting bootlegs, and it was on 'Fire on the Fingertips' and one of the Main Point 1975 boots." "At the Boston Show, he wore a white ruffled tuxedo shirt, black jacket and black pants, ran around the stage like a madman, and mugged with Clarence Clemons throughout the night. To this day, I recall thinking and telling my buddy “If this guy was discovered, he would be an incredibly famous rock star…” That is the absolute truth, but my music friends to this day think I’m trying to boast when I tell them the details of this story. I don’t remember anything about Chicago’s performance – are you surprised?"

SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT (start cut, 4.11) / DOES THIS BUS STOP AT 82ND STREET? (3.35) / PHANTOMS (4.42) / SECRET TO THE BLUES (edits, 7.05) / TAKE ME OUT TO THE BALL GAME (0.44) / SEASIDE BAR SONG (3.04) / THUNDERCRACK (cut, 4.02)

One show, double bill, with Bruce and the boys opening for headliners Chicago. The eleventh of thirteen consecutive shows and the first concert at the new Broome County Veterans Memorial Arena. The above-mentioned seven-song, 45-minute setlist almost certainly represents Bruce's complete show, bearing in mind the strict time limit Bruce was under for these Chicago shows. The show includes a brief (but unique) rendition of "Take Me Out To The Ball Game", as well as "Phantoms" (aka 'Over The Hills Of Saint George"), the work-in-progress composition that soon became "Zero And Blind Terry".

Audience tape. This performance available via a good quality audience recording of forty minutes duration. The set closer, "Thundercrack", is not complete; "Secret To The Blues" and "Spirit In The Night" are marred by minor edits. Previously only available in poor quality, a new transfer emerged in March 2013 from the JEMS Archive. The fidelity of this tape is a material upgrade over all previous copies and is well worth acquiring.

1973-06-14 - MADISON SQUARE GARDEN, NEW YORK CITY, NY

SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / BLINDED BY THE LIGHT / LOST IN THE FLOOD / THUNDERCRACK

No set details known. One show, double bill, with Springsteen opening for headliner Chicago. The twelfth of thirteen consecutive shows and Bruce's first appearance at Madison Square Garden. Both artists’ entire performance on this night were professionally videotaped and shown real time on the large screen above/behind the stage, although none of this footage has ever surfaced to collectors. It’s unknown if this video still survives in Springsteen’s archives. Springsteen performed an extra encore at this show, so the performance was over an hour. According to comments by drummer Vini Lopez (who noted the filming of this show) the promoter was upset the band played longer than its allotted time and so the following night the crew only filmed headliner Chicago’s set, not the Springsteen performance. A contributor to the Greasy Lake website recalls the above songs were performed, with "Thundercrack" as the set closer. While roadie Albee Tellone did not recall the filming, he speculated that Mike Appel never was allowed access to the video. It's doubtful if Bruce wanted a copy. By this time, according to Albee, Bruce was thoroughly tired of playing on the tour and couldn't wait for it to end.

Albee Tellone says that Springsteen never played in West Virginia while he was driving the band's equipment, so it's likely this show was cancelled. Albee also said that the band needed a rest after the Chicago tour and had to get back into the studio to work on The Wild, The Innocent & The E Street Shuffle, which had some basic tracks already recorded.

1973-07-18 - MAX'S KANSAS CITY, NEW YORK CITY, NY

Early (first) show: WILD BILLY'S CIRCUS STORY / GROWIN' UP / SOMETHING YOU GOT

Late (second) show: SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / NEW YORK CITY SERENADE / (GET YOUR KICKS ON) ROUTE 66

Two shows, double billing, with Springsteen headlining and The Wailers (led by Bob Marley) opening. This was the start of a six-night (12-show) residency. It was also The Wailers first-ever U.S.A. tour, which had started the week before with a six-night (12-show) headlining stint in Boston at Paul’s Mall. The above-mentioned very partial setlist from Springsteen's early show is culled from a review by Michael Gross (not the actor) in Miscellany News, the student newspaper of Vassar College. Gross only states that he attended the opening night of Springsteen's residence, so the songs he mentioned in his review could have been from the late show. "Something You Got" is noted as the final song of the set. Meanwhile, the late show setlist is culled from a critique by Steve Simels in Stereo Review, who mentioned that Bruce opened with "Spirit In The Night" and performed "(Get Your Kicks On) Route 66" as the result of his own shouted request from the audience. There is no known audio from either show. A Wailers-centric review of the show was printed in the September 1 issue of Billboard. Brucebase has placed a reproduction here, but the subject of the review could be any of the twelve shows that Springsteen and The Wailers played in this stand. In November 1976 it was reported in New Musical Express that Springsteen and the Wailers had signed a deal to co-headline a 40-city U.S. tour that was due to start in mid-April 1977, with the two acts alternating as headliners. A spokeman at the time suggested that British and European dates would follow in the summer of 1977.

An audience recording of The Wailer's first show has circulated for many years. The Wailers' setlist for this early show was as follows: "Put It On", "Slave Driver", "Burnin' And Lootin'", "Stop That Train", "Kinky Reggae", and "Stir It Up". Bruce did not play during their set. The original taper seems to have had decent equipment and a choice recording spot. Previous information suggested that a circulating fifty minute audience recording of a Springsteen set at Max's Kansas City was from this date, in fact the recording is sourced from the early show on July 23, at the end of the stand. Despite similar audio characteristics these two recordings were made by different tapers on different nights. The Wailer's recording is the only audio of an undercard of a Springsteen show of the post-1971 era that has ever surfaced and it could not be a more significant one. It has apparently been known by hard core Marley collectors for years but has only come to the attention of Springsteen collectors recently. It is available on private CDR via Marley/Wailers collector sources. The Wailers segment of audio runs about 38 minutes (including between song tuning). This is not the complete show but it probably represents most of the gig, bearing in mind this was the early show on a two show, two artist bill. Albee Tellone reported that the "early" shows were always shorter to turn over the crowd and allow the many people waiting in line for the late shows, which ran right up until the legal operating hours.

WILD BILLY'S CIRCUS STORY / ZERO AND BLIND TERRY

Two shows, double bill, with Springsteen and band headlining and The Wailers (lineup including Bob Marley and Peter Tosh) opening. One of the shows on this run was played almost exclusively to record executives and invited journalists. A review of this show was written for Village Voice by Lorraine O'Grady but went unpublished at the time as the editor did not believe either Springsteen or Marley would make it. The article has since been published in Steven Kasher's history of Max's Kansas City. The songs listed above were not necessarily played on this exact date.

1973-07-20 - MAX'S KANSAS CITY, NEW YORK CITY, NY

KITTY'S BACK

No other set details known. Two shows, double bill, with Springsteen and band headlining and The Wailers (lineup including Bob Marley and Peter Tosh) opening. Albee Tellone remembered that the Wailers were: Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, Joe Higgs (vocals, percussion), Earl Lindo (keyboards), Aston "Family Man" Barrett (bass) and his brother Carlton Barrett on drums. Albee was told by the Wailers manager that they sent singer/percussionist Bunny Wailer back to Jamaica after their performances in the UK prior to the USA tour.

A good quality soundboard recording of "Kitty's Back" from around this date is in circulation. Slight variations in the lyrics compared to later performances suggest it is an early recording, and a reference to Basin Street (instead of Bleecker Street) in the second verse indicates it may be from Max's Kansas City. Basin Street East was a famous nightclub in New York City, located just a few blocks from Max's. We've placed the song here, but it could be from any of the shows in the stand.

Early Show: NEW YORK CITY SERENADE

No other set details known. Two shows, double bill, with Springsteen and band headlining and The Wailers (lineup including Bob Marley and Peter Tosh) opening. An attendee notes that the early show set opened with "New York City Serenade". The club was almost empty, with just eight lucky observers! One of whom kept shouting for "Lost In The Flood" which was not played, much to his frustration. The attendee says he wasn't a particular big Springsteen fan, but was blown away by the performance. So much so he stayed for the late show, and returned the next day with his tape recorder - see the listing below.

1973-07-23 - MAX'S KANSAS CITY, NEW YORK CITY, NY

Early (first) show: NEW YORK CITY SERENADE (8:11) / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) (6:46) / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT (4:57) / DOES THIS BUS STOP AT 82ND STREET? (4:09) / SOMETHING YOU GOT (6:41) / ZERO AND BLIND TERRY (6:08) / THUNDERCRACK (edited, 11:27)

Two shows, double bill, with Springsteen and band headlining and The Wailers (line-up including Bob Marley and Peter Tosh) opening. Final night. The above-mentioned setlist details for the early show are culled from an 50-minute audience recording of very good sound quality that has been in circulation (with widely varying levels of completeness) for over 25 years. This recording has historically been attributed to July 18, 1973, but it's actually from this night.

The taper (George) takes up the story and writes down this piece of Bruce History: "I decided to borrow my mom's portable Sony stereo cassette recorder to tape the show. I also (unfortunately) brought only one cassette - A TDK C-90SD (which I still have to this day). I made sure that the batteries were fresh and I was ready to document the event. The mic was a stereo mic so my goal was to sit in the middle of the room. I didn't think that this would be a problem since, as I said, there was literally no one in the club the night before. I figured that I would pay for my own ticket for the Monday night show and didn't even bother to call my friend at Columbia and get my name on the list again.

"The club was upstairs from the main Max's room and when we get to the club and climbed the stairs I was shocked to see that the club was full of people. I thought to myself "where the hell did all of these people come from" started worrying that it may be sold out and we may not get in. The guy at the door told us that he could seat the three of us but that we were going to have to sit in the front row!

"He led us to the front and sat is in the center seats (my seat was about three feet in front of the center stage mic). My mind was racing like crazy. Because of the placement of the PA speakers (they were hung right above the stage angled slightly down) the "vocal" sound was not going to be the best sitting that close to the stage (the "prime" spot for a good vocal sound would have been 5 rows back). I also was freaking because I didn't know what I was going to do with the mic. It wouldn't be very discreet of me if I held the mic up in front of me since (as I said) the mic stand was right in front of me and Bruce would plainly see that I was taping him! I should have brought a second cassette to tape Marley but, alas, I didn't. I didn't want to risk running out of tape by recording the Marley/Wailers set on my lone cassette so I (regretfully) didn't and saved the tape for Springsteen.

"Sitting that close to Marley was an experience like none other I have experienced before or since. I received a one-on-one lesson in reggae from the master himself! I'm sure it was helped by the constant thick smoke coming off the stage directly into my face! I will also never forget that at one point in Bob's set he shook his hair and his perspiration flew all over me. Some might say that was my reggae baptism. I was pretty blitzed by the end of his set and totally ready for Bruce.

"I tried to "hide" the mic by holding it near my crotch rather than shoving it right in front of Bruce's face. Another regret that I have is that I didn't let the recording go on uninterrupted. I would have normally not stopped the tape after each song. Since the recorder and mic had been originally designed for office dictation, the mic had an on/off switch which stopped the recorder but left it in the record mode. This created a "wowing" effect at the turn off and turn on points of the recording (note: this is why the circulating recordings are cut at the start and finish so severely). I didn't know how long BS would play and I, as I said, I was in an altered state, so I worried that that one C90 tape was not going to be enough to get the entire show. Given the eventual length of the set it was an unwarranted fear but at that moment I was not thinking clearly.

"The show was, again, amazing. Bruce worked the full room to the fullest and was funny, animated, charismatic and even better that the night before. The set (as captured on my tape) was New York City Serenade / Sandy / Spirit In The Night / Does This Bus Stop At 82nd St / Something You Got / Zero And Blind Terry / Thundercrack. My friends were knocked out and became life-long fans. I was convinced that I had seen the greatest performer that had ever existed and, like any true convert, began spreading the word to anyone who would listen to me.

Among the people over the years who have mentioned that they attended at least one of the Springsteen / Wailers performances during this residency are Alice Cooper, Lou Reed, Patti Smith, Garland Jeffreys and Steve Van Zandt. Albee Tellone recalled talking to Todd Rundgren standing in line. He bumped Todd and his girlfriend ahead of the line and gave them a table because he was "a guy from New Jersey". Harry Chapin was there the same night and had a short conversation with Rundgren before Albee whisked him through.

All seven of the known Springsteen songs from this early show can be found as tracks 6-12 on the CD 'The Unsurpassed Springsteen, Vol 2' (Yellow Dog). However these seven songs had an unfortunate, notoriously confusing tape-boot appearance history prior to their appearance of this CD. The seven songs have tended to be cannibalised, re-sequenced and/or misidentified as emanating for a variety of different shows. For example, all the songs except “Thundercrack” and “Does This Bus Stop At 82nd Street?” are found on the 'All Those Years' boxed set, but they’re re-sequenced. The two songs not found on 'All Those Years' (“Thundercrack” and “Does This Bus Stop At 82nd Street?”) have tended to turn up identified as emanating from all kinds of sources and often listed as a soundboard (which they are not). For example, the alleged previously uncirculating soundboard performance of “Thundercrack” found on a radio station cassette tape and subsequently auctioned by Backstreets Magazine several years ago has turned out to be nothing more than this same audience source recording. Since it is “Thundercrack” that most often circulates misidentified, it should be noted that the original taper appears to have made a decision to edit “Thundercrack” (the mid-song band introductions of Lopez and Clemons are heard but Bruce’s introductions of Sancious, Federici and Tallent have been cut completely unintentionally making it easy to identify this recording). Unedited audio of this performance of “Thundercrack” has never turned up.

1973-07-27 - FAIRMONT HOTEL, SAN FRANCISCO, CA

4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) / ZERO AND BLIND TERRY / IT'S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY / THUNDERCRACK

One show, with Springsteen and the boys performing along with numerous other artists as part of the CBS Sales Convention, a three-day, private corporate function that was not open to the public. Artists were not paid except for travel expenses. The above-mentioned setlist represents Springsteen's complete performance. Bruce, who had to be pressured to attend this event, had the misfortune to follow Edgar Winter's White Trash, who performed a visually spectacular 15-minute set complete with fireworks and smoke bombs which the partying CBS reps loved. Bruce's performance, on the other hand, was low key and without props. "4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)" was performed acoustically and "Thundercrack" included the lengthy comedy middle section. Artists were supposed to play only two or three songs and be finished in 15 minutes. Consequently Springsteen's 40-minute set upset some in the audience, who felt he was grandstanding. Even John Hammond later commented "Bruce came onstage with a chip on his shoulder and played way too long".

This private CBS function is often confused with the May 1 Ahmanson Theatre show in Los Angeles (a normal public concert). The CBS-financed promotional film of Bruce's performance at Ahmanson Theatre was shown in its entirety at this Convention.

There is no circulating audio form this show.

Two shows, double bill, with Springsteen and band headlining and Nashville-based country singer-songwriter Alex Harvey on the undercard. Opening of a sellout, three-night (six-show) residency. Bruce’s second show of this evening was broadcast live on WLIR-FM as part of its weekly Tuesday evening simulcast from the venue. The orchestral violin/string sounds heard during ‘New York City Serenade’ were produced by using a rented Mellotron (unlike the real strings on the album version). Albee Tellone recalls that the Mellotron became a regular resident of his equipment van. It was brought to 914 Studio many times during the recording of The Wild, The Innocent & The E Street Shuffle, but four local music teachers were hired to play the string arrangement which was conducted by David Sancious.

The above-noted setlist represents the circulating audio from this show. This very good quality audio was taped off the airways and represents the entire broadcast, although the performance almost certainly included two to four additional songs that never went to air due to time limitations. Available on the CD ‘My Father's Place' (Great Dane) and in better quality on the CD ‘Jacksonville & My Father's Place'. The show has recently circulated from the radio station master tape which is worth seeking out.

1973-09-08 - FLAGSTAFF HILL, SCHENLEY PARK, UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH, PITTSBURGH, PA

DOES THIS BUS STOP AT 82ND STREET? / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / NEW YORK CITY SERENADE / IT'S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY / THE E STREET SHUFFLE / GROWIN' UP / MAMA DON'T ALLOW NO GUITAR PICKING

One afternoon show, triple bill, with Springsteen and band playing between Estus and the headliner Buzzy Linhart. The setlist above would seem to consist of the complete performance, and is supplied by a visitor to the Killing Floor website and is unverified, but plausible. "Mama Don't Allow No Guitar Picking" is a traditional bluegrass song first recorded in the 1920s but is probably based on earlier songs including "Mr. Crump Don't Allow No Easy Riders" (from 1907) and "Mama Don't Allow No Low Down Hangin' Around"). Also known under other titles including "Mama Don't Allow" and "Mama Don't Allow No Guitar Playing Around Here". It has been covered by artists such as Papa Charlie Jackson (1925), The Rivieras (1964), and J.J. Cale (1981). Although intended as a social event for students returning from summer vacation, this was a free concert that was open to the general public. Sponsored by the University’s Penn Program Council and held outdoors on the lawn of the Flagstaff Hill section of Schenley Park (next to the Botanical Gardens). The event was covered in The Pitt News, but sadly the reporter does not offer any details about Springsteen's set. Albee recently noted that there were not a lot of people in attendance but it was a great show.

There is no known audio.

1973-09-09 - REC HALL, PENN STATE UNIVERSITY, UNIVERSITY PARK, PA

Cancelled Springsteen performance, although the concert went ahead anyway. This was originally scheduled to be one show, double bill, with Bruce and band opening for headliner New Riders Of The Purple Sage. However Springsteen pulled out of the gig and the New Riders ended up headlining without an opening act. The Springsteen withdrawal was prior to any public announcement or promotion for the show, so the attendees were not aware an opening act had been planned anyway. This was the first of a series of several Springsteen gigs that were cancelled, apparently because final mixing of the second album, and its promised delivery to Columbia, had fallen behind schedule and additional studio time was needed to finish the album.

Concert is triple-billed, with Springsteen intended to follow the Julian Strut Band, and Richie Havens rounding off the bill. After pulling out two days before the show Springsteen is replaced by Wet Willie. The Julian Strut Band dropped out shortly after the publicity was printed and were not replaced.

1973-09-28 - HAMPDEN-SYDNEY COLLEGE, HAMPDEN SYDNEY, VA

THE E STREET SHUFFLE (with Albee Tellone)

One show, with Springsteen and band the sole act on the bill. This was the first night back on tour after the three-week hiatus required to complete the Wild & Innocent album. This is also considered to be the first show of the Wild & Innocent Tour, however the concept of a tour to support the album is very much a modern construct. The band were touring constantly, and would continue to do so until March 1975. There was very little promotion or press. This show also marked the live debut of "The E Street Shuffle", as well as the first-ever guest slot in the lineup by Albee ("Albany Al") Tellone on baritone sax. Tellone, who had been a member of Bruce’s band during the 1971 Friendly Enemies/Dr Zoom period, had been working as the Greetings Tour sound manager since November 1972. Tellone would end making stage appearances in the band (but only during gigs where “The E Street Shuffle” was played) from this night up until mid-December 1973, when Albee left the tour to start his own band.

1973-09-29 - WAYNESBURG COLLEGE, WAYNESBURG, PA

No set details known. One show, with Springsteen and band the lone act on the bill. Last minute difficulties with the College-supplied grand piano caused a delay to the start of the concert. Albee Tellone recalled that a professional piano tuner was finishing up as he and partner Jeff Hall set up the band for a sound check. "When the sound check started, we knew immediately that something was wrong". Danny Federici figured out that the man had tuned the piano to itself (very common) but it didn't match the notes on his organ which is tuned by a tone generator onboard the B-3. The sound check went on as well as colud be without the piano. "The tuner returned and had to tune to notes on the B-3 organ being played by Danny Federici. The crowd started to take their seats while he was finishing up. When he finished he stood up and bowed to the audience who gave him big round of applause". "We actually started the show on time", said Albee.

1973-09-30 - PRITCHARD GYMNASIUM, STONY BROOK UNIVERSITY, STONY BROOK, NY

No set details known. One show, held in the Pritchard Gymnasium, with Bruce and the band the only act on the bill. Even though admission was free for students of the school the concert was not a sellout. A brief report the following day in the school’s newspaper mentions that one of Springsteen’s acoustic guitars had been stolen at this gig and requests its return. Albee Tellone reported that he always brought along his own personal acoustic guitar which happened to be the same model Bruce had. They were placed in the dressing room side by side, but only Bruce's was taken. Probably because he had a newer case for it. Bruce used Albee's guitar for the remainder of the year until Mike Appel bought him a new one for Christmas.

1973-10-06 - VILLANOVA FIELD HOUSE, VILLANOVA UNIVERSITY, VILLANOVA, PA

Pre-show jam: PEACEFUL EASY FEELING

No set details known. One show, double bill, held in the Villanova Field House, with Springsteen and band co-headlining with Jackson Browne, two future Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame members on the same bill for a mere $4 admission fee! Springsteen opened and Jackson Browne closed, but both gave headliner length 90-minute performances. Once alluded to by Browne in interview as "a truly magical night", this show was also referred to in Springsteen’s speech inducting Browne into the Hall Of Fame. Incredibly there was no post-concert review of this concert in Villanova's school newspaper, but the event was considered a "financial success" by the Villanova Union. Albee Tellone has noted that before this show Springsteen and Browne jammed together, with Springsteen playing The Eagles' "Peaceful Easy Feeling".

1973-10-13 - KENNEDY CENTER CONCERT HALL, WASHINGTON, DC

Cancelled Springsteen concert, never rescheduled. Originally planned as one show, in the 500-seat Concert Hall, with Springsteen and band the sole act on the bill. This Columbia Records-organized affair was promoted in the Washington Post (see the advertisement linked above) a week prior to the event, advertised as a 'Special National Preview Performance' of the forthcoming The Wild, The Innocent & The E Street Shuffle album, which was still three weeks (November 5) away from public release. The show was cancelled on the very day of the event, with a notice being placed in the Washington Post informing people of ticket refund details. The notice doesn’t state why the show was cancelled. Tour Sound Manager Albee Tellone confirmed this show’s cancellation.

1973-10-20 - FRANKLIN PIERCE COLLEGE, RINDGE, NH

One show with Bruce and the band the sole act on the bill. The 11-song setlist above is a recollection of an attendee and would seem to represent the complete gig. A brief snippet of information on a blog, by an unidentified blogger, suggests that this show was held during a snowstorm and was attended by only around 50 fans. Some sources list two extra songs at the end of the set, "Mama Don't All No Guitar Picking" and "Call On Me". The latter may be the 1963 song by blues and soul singer Bobby "Blue" Bland, but it is far more likely to actually be "634-5789", which Springsteen was regularly playing around this time.

There is no known audio recording of any of this show.

1973-10-26 - GENEVA THEATRE, GENEVA, NY

NEW YORK CITY SERENADE / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / DOES THIS BUS STOP AT 82ND STREET? / BLINDED BY THE LIGHT / 634-5789 (SOULSVILLE, U.S.A.) / FOR YOU / THUNDERCRACK / TWIST AND SHOUT

One show, double bill with Bruce and the boys headlining and The James Montgomery Band opening. Booked for a fee of $2,000 by the nearby Hobart & William Smith College. The College had originally contracted John Sebastian as the sole act for this evening, but he cancelled a couple of weeks before the gig and the Student Concert Committee was able to procure both Springsteen and Montgomery's services for the same price. Montgomery opened with a 60-minute, Chicago blues-dominated set. Apparently Bruce and the band arrived late in an old black station wagon, roaring down an alley beside the theatre. Springsteen's show lasted 90 minutes and included a triple encore, finishing with "Twist And Shout". Partial setlist above gathered from various sources that attended the show, including Tom.

Two shows, double bill, with Springsteen and band headlining and local acoustic trio Wire And Wood opening. The above-mentioned setlist is the complete twelve-song, second (late) show, as articulated by John Baumgartner in a detailed review in the November 7 edition of The Villanovan. Albee "Albany Al" Tellone (baritone sax) performed on "The E Street Shuffle”. Richard Blackwell was also a guest on congas at this gig. Bruce played piano on one song, "Spirit In The Night", and ended the main set with a full band version of "For You". "Blinded By The Light" and "634-5789 (Soulsville, U.S.A.)" were the two encores.

There is no known audio from this show.

1973-10-31 - THE MAIN POINT, BRYN MAWR, PA

Two shows, double bill, with Springsteen and band headlining and acoustic trio Wire And Wood opening. Halloween night. This setlist is similar to the previous night's gig, but with slightly different song sequencing in the second half of the show. "Zero And Blind Terry" and "Thundercrack" were added for this show but the previous night's "634-5789 (Soulsville, U.S.A.)" was dropped. "For You" is the full band version. Albee "Albany Al" Tellone guests on baritone sax on "The E Street Shuffle".

The above-mentioned thirteen-song setlist is culled from a circulating audience tape of fair to good quality that is believed to be the second (late) show. The two 'cut' tracks (noted above) are not circulating complete. The CD 'Before The Flood' (CU) has the entire show except for "Thundercrack".

1973-11-03 - PUTNAM GYMNASIUM, RICKER COLLEGE, HOULTON, ME

No set details known. One show, a co-headlining double bill held in the school's Putnam Gymnasium, with Springsteen and band opening and Orleans closing. Springsteen and John Hall, the leader of Orleans, had often performed with their respective bands on the same bill at the Café Wha? in New York City in late 1967 (see listings). Bruce and the band arrived in a mini-bus in the afternoon and were given a walking tour of the campus by students in the Ricker Concert Committee. Ed Malloy, chair of the College's social board organised Springsteen's appearance, and writes: "Late that afternoon with sound checks going on, a guy walks up to me and asks, 'Where does the Springsteen band set up?' I ask if he's the road manager. He says, 'No, man, I'm Bruce.' Forever embarrassed, I show him to their dressing room (the girls locker room - girls not included). Frank Wingate is shooting hoops with Clarence Clemons and Scott Berry is getting him loaded. At Showtime, Orleans comes out cooking and wins the crowd over. I'm in the wings dancing and grinning. Bruce walks up beside me with his guitar slung over his back and starts dancing as well. He points to the The Raunchy Bunch in front of the stage - they're in full swing. He shouts over to me "Good band" I nod and smile in time and say 'yeah'. He comes right up to the side of my face and says "we're going to blow them away". If you were there you know he backed that up and them some. In a December 2006 Washington Post interview John Hall (now a U.S. Congressman) recalled this gig and jokingly commented: “Bruce was supposed to play for 45 minutes…he played for two hours and 45 minutes”.
00Photo-32.png
The Wild, The Innocent & The E Street Shuffle, Springsteen's second album, is released on November 5, 1973. However, the album receives very little press - there were no advertisements in the trades, no release party. The band weren't even sure when the album was going to hit the stores.

1973-11-06 - MAX'S KANSAS CITY, NEW YORK CITY, NY

No set details known. Two shows, double bill, with Springsteen and band headlining and Daryl Hall & John Oates opening. Opening of a five-night (ten-show) residency at the club. Although originally booked for three nights, two additional nights were added to the itinerary. Hall & Oates performed for about 45 minutes at each show, with Springsteen performing for about 90 minutes. Albany Al Tellone continued his brief one or two song guest appearance at some (probably all) of these ten shows. A Brucebase reader who attended reports "Hall & Oates were not well received by the partisan Springsteen crowds." A short review of one of the Max's shows that included Hall and Oates appeared in the Billboard November 24, 1973. The only song mentioned specifically was "634-5789 (Soulsville, U.S.A.)". Click the link above to read it. Brucebase has placed the review under this date, although the show described could be any of the ten that Springsteen played in this stand.

"Lost In The Flood" from one of the Max's Kansas City shows in 1973 was in the video reel at the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame exhibition. This would have been shot in black and white with a single camera by Barry Rebo, similar to the Max's Kansas City footage from 1972. This video could be from any of the Max's shows in 1973, either July or November. It is perhaps more likely to be November, given that we have no record of any "Lost In The Flood" performances in or around July '73.

One show, double bill, with Bruce and the boys opening for headliner Brian Auger's Oblivion Express. An article in the college newspaper indicates that David Bromberg was originally scheduled to headline this show but opted out after being informed that Springsteen was going to open the show. Bromberg was aware of the difficulty in following Bruce. Brian Auger probably wished he'd been aware too, as the vast majority of the 1,500 strong full house in Kendall Hall left after Bruce's performance. Seven of the eight songs listed above were mentioned as having been performed at this concert in a school newspaper review that followed. The other (Dylan's "I Want You") is a recollection of John Sciarappa, who was present at this show. If accurate, this brings back the performing history of the song by nearly a year - with the next recorded performance in November 1974, at Philadelphia's Tower Theater. Given that Bruce was the opening act this setlist is likely to represent nearly the entire show, with perhaps only one or two songs undocumented.

There is no circulating audio from this show.

1973-11-17 - ROXY THEATRE, PHILADELPHIA, PA

WALKING THE DOG / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / DOES THIS BUS STOP AT 82ND STREET? / THE E STREET SHUFFLE - HAVING A PARTY (with Albee Tellone) / NEW YORK CITY SERENADE / YOU MEAN SO MUCH TO ME / IT'S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY / 634-5789 (SOULSVILLE, U.S.A.) / FOR YOU / THUNDERCRACK / TWIST AND SHOUT

Two shows, with Springsteen and band headlining. Two or three local bands (names unverified) acted as the undercards. This was an unusual show structure, as the first show took place during the day but the second show was not until much later in the evening. It is likely that the second show is the source of the circulating audience recording. It should be noted that these shows were held at the Roxy Theatre in the Manayunk neighbourhood of Philadelphia, and not the same venue as the more well-known, up-market Roxy Theatre ten miles away in the heart of downtown Philadelphia. The theatre was on the corner of Ridge and Leverington Ave, and was knocked down in 1981. A Dunkin' Donuts currently sits on the site of the Theatre. Advanced ticket sales were slow, which necessitated Bruce plugging the gig the previous three nights at his My Father's Place residency. Bruce can be heard twice thanking the crowd for traveling to (in Bruce's words) "this God-forsaken place" to support him. Albee Tellone guests on baritone sax on "The E Street Shuffle", as he did during most of the September-December 1973 gigs. "For You" is the solo piano version. "Thundercrack" includes an exceptionally long band-introduction segment. Click the link above to view photographs of the show taken by Art Reilly.

The above-mentioned setlist is taken from an audience recording of only fair sound quality, although slightly better during the slower songs. This audio has continuity (there was no set break intermission) and captures the complete eleven-song, 90-minute performance. "You Mean So Much To Me" is cut and missing its final two minutes. Audience tape of average quality available via the CDR 'Electric Surges Free'.

WALKING THE DOG / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / NEW YORK CITY SERENADE / DOES THIS BUS STOP AT 82ND STREET? / KITTY’S BACK / THUNDERCRACK / 634-5789 (SOULSVILLE, U.S.A.)

One show, double bill, with Springsteen and band opening for British blues godfather John Mayall. This was a two-night booking for headliner Mayall, with Springsteen on the undercard the first night and Maria Muldaur on the bill the following night. Interestingly 30% of the seats for the Springsteen show remained unsold but the show with Boston-based Muldaur was a quick sell-out.

The above-mentioned setlist is culled from a 70-minute audience recording and is not available on any mainstream boot. The sound is very muddy and the overall quality is only fair. Fortunately the audio has continuity and, at 70 minutes, is likely to represent Bruce’s complete performance as the opening act. Includes the earliest definitively-dated "Kitty's Back", although an earlier version (probably from the summer of 1973 based on lyrical variations) entered circulation in 2017 on the 'Odds & Sods' collection.

1973-11-30 - VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY, RICHMOND, VA

Due to last minute venue/contractual difficulties at VCU, this concert was postponed and rescheduled to January 25, 1974 at The Mosque. This concert was to have featured Springsteen headlining and Goose Creek Symphony as the opener and, indeed, this was the lineup that performed at the January 25, 1974 show. It's likely that the concert was planned to be held in the VCU Gym, but we have no publicity or stubs to prove this.

Cancelled by Springsteen the day of the show. It was intended to be a single show, double bill, with Springsteen and band (as they’d done the previous week at University of Massachusetts) opening for John Mayall. Bruce was a $1500 contract, Mayall was paid extra to play an additional set. The school’s Yearbook includes several photos of Mayall’s performance. Thanks to Jeff Wood for the information.



1973-12-06 - CHILDE HAROLD, WASHINGTON, DC

WALKING THE DOG (10:25) / FOR YOU (9:56) / THE E STREET SHUFFLE - HAVING A PARTY (with Albee Tellone, 7:02) / KITTY'S BACK (9:45)

One show, with Springsteen and band the sole act on the bill. A more than two-hour performance that involved three 45-minute sets with an intermission between each.

A proportion of this night's total show (audio evidence suggests it was the evening's final set) was broadcast on the radio by Georgetown University's WGTB-FM. The above-mentioned partial setlist is from the only known circulating portions of this rare broadcast. This audio emanates from a source that taped it off the airways, not the station's original tape. Consequently the sound quality is very good, but not brilliant. "For You" is the solo piano version. Albany Al Tellone guests on "The E Street Shuffle". The four above-mentioned tracks can be found on the CD 'Play The Tuba And Run'. Two other tracks included on this CD are not (as claimed) from this show, or even this venue. These involve an audience recording of "Does This Bus Stop at 82nd Street?" (from an-as-yet-unidentified location, not Childe Harold) and an incomplete soundboard recording of "Let The Four Winds Blow" (from January 6, 1974 at Joe's Place). This same audience recording of "Does This Bus Stop At 82nd Street?" can be found on the CDs 'The Inner View' or 'The Bruce Springsteen Collection, Volume 2'.

No setlist details known. One show, with Springsteen and band the sole act on the bill. A more than two-hour performance that involved three 45-minute sets with an intermission between each. The upcoming events section of the October 13, 1973 Phoenix Arizona Republic indicates that Springsteen was scheduled to play Phoenix's Celebrity Theatre on December 8 in support of Roger McGuinn. Presumably at some point this performance was cancelled.

1973-12-14 - PINECREST COUNTRY CLUB, SHELTON, CT

No set details known. One show, double bill, with Springsteen and band headlining. This gig has been rumored as having been cancelled. However senior management at Pinecrest (who were there in 1973) have positively confirmed that it took place. A local area band (name undocumented) opened the show. This was a hastily organized booking, with little time available for pre-concert advertising and promotion. Consequently only about 200 tickets were sold (the venue held over 600). A 90-minute performance by Bruce.

1973-12-15 - NASSAU COMMUNITY COLLEGE, GARDEN CITY, NY

4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) / NEW YORK CITY SERENADE / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / WALKING THE DOG / THUNDERCRACK / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT)

No other set details known. Some or all of this show was filmed in black and white by Barry Rebo. The first two tracks above (the opening pairing) were shown by Thom Zimny at the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame discussion in June 2009. "New York City Serenade" was also shown to the public at "An Evening With Thom Zimny" at Monmouth University on September 23, 2014. Two brief snippets of "4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)" (with audio) can also be seen in the documentary Bruce Springsteen: In His Own Words, which was first broadcast in December 2016 on Channel 4 in the UK. Short clips have also been seen in various promotional videos, and in the Wings For Wheels documentary on the Born To Run 30th Anniversary Edition box set, most notably showing Dave Sancious during "New York City Serenade". Peter Ames Carlin goes into some detail about this show in chapter 11 of Bruce, listing three other songs, "Spirit In The Night", "Walking The Dog", and "Thundercrack". Carlin even transcribes some of Springsteen's spoken introductions as well as describing the events on stage, suggesting he had the opportunity to view Rebo's footage. The final song listed above, "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)", is courtesy of an attendee.

1973-12-16 - SHABOO, WILLIMANTIC, CT

Cancelled show, never rescheduled. Originally scheduled as one show, with Bruce and the boys the sole act on the bill. Shaboo was a now-legendary watering hole that catered for students at nearby Eastern Connecticut University. A student at the school in December 1973 has commented to Brucebase “I didn’t attend Shaboo that night but my dorm room-mate went and I seem to recall him returning later that evening and telling me that Springsteen hadn’t showed up!” The show’s cancellation has been corroborated in comments by former Shaboo owner/manager David Foster, who has stated that Springsteen’s camp phoned and cancelled only a day or two before the scheduled appearance. Springsteen also cancelled his April 1973 show at the same venue.

1973-12-20 - BRISTOL MOTOR INN, BRISTOL, RI

SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / SANTA CLAUS IS COMIN' TO TOWN / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT)

One show, with Bruce and the boys the only act on the bill. Unusual show in that it was an official Roger Williams University school event but it was held off campus, inside the nightclub of the Bristol Motor Inn. This was an 100-minute show. Partial setlist above comes from a newspaper review of the performance. "Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town" is likely to have been performed at many of the gigs in this December Christmas period.

1973-12-21 - SANDY'S, BEVERLY, MA

No set details known. One show, double bill, with Springsteen and band headlining and The Bill Colwell Band opening. Sandy's, located in an outer north shore suburb of Boston, was a small, rock-orientated club that had opened in early '73. The only known promotion and ad for this gig (in the December 15 edition of The Boston Real Paper) carries the unique billing of 'Bruce Springsteen and his studio musicians', indicating the club wanted people to know that this was going to be rock show, not a solo performance.

1973-12-22 - UNCLE AL'S ERLTON THEATRE LOUNGE, CHERRY HILL, NJ

No set details known. One show, triple bill, with Springsteen and band headlining. Undercards were local bands Uproar (who opened) and Moxie (who played second). Both local bands were performing a week-long residency at the club but Springsteen was a special, last minute addition to this night's itinerary. Both local groups played for about an hour. Springsteen took the stage just before midnight and performed for about two hours.
00Photo-32.png

1973-12-23 - ROVA FARM FUNCTION CENTER, JACKSON, NJ

SANTA CLAUS IS COMIN' TO TOWN

One show, triple bill, headlined by Springsteen and band. Some confusion reigned in the weeks leading up to this event, with Springsteen at first billed, then pulling out of the event, then finally back on the bill. One of the two undercard groups was Doo Dah (led by George Theiss, Springsteen’s former bandmate in The Castiles). By all accounts a pretty wild affair, with the admission fee including food and all the beer one could drink! The show started late due to technical problems. About half way into Springsteen’s set he played "Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town", only to have a serious brawl erupt in the audience during the song. Consequently the police became embroiled and the promoters had to do some fast talking to get the police to let the show continue. Rova Farm was not a "farm", but a congregation center operated by the local Russian Orthodox community. This show, sometimes listed as being held outdoors, was definitely indoors, as you would expect in the middle of winter.

1974-01-04 - JOE'S PLACE, CAMBRIDGE, MA

No set details known. One show, double bill, with Springsteen and band headlining and Peter Johnson & The Manic Depressives (Joe’s unofficial house band) opening. This was opening night of a three-night (three-show) residency.
00Photo-32.png

1974-01-05 - JOE'S PLACE, CAMBRIDGE, MA

No set details known. One show, double bill, with Springsteen and band headlining and Peter Johnson & The Manic Depressives (Joe’s unofficial house band) opening. A live version of “Thundercrack” found on the boot ‘Deep Down In The Vaults’ (E Street Records) is not from this show, as is claimed in the liner notes. It’s the edited version of the performance from Max’s Kansas City on January 31, 1973.

An 'orphaned' audience recording of “Does This Bus Stop At 82nd Street?” has been linked to either this show or the Childe Harold gig of December 6, 1973. However, it is unlikely to be from this show. Also, the artwork (and subsequent info files) for the CD bootleg "Greetings From Liberty Hall tx" (Wonderland Records) indicate that four tracks from this show are included - this is an error, they are in fact sourced from the January 6 show.

1974-01-06 - JOE'S PLACE, CAMBRIDGE, MA

Soundcheck: DOES THIS BUS STOP AT 82ND STREET? / DOES THIS BUS STOP AT 82ND STREET?

NEW YORK CITY SERENADE / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / DOES THIS BUS STOP AT 82ND STREET? / WALKING THE DOG / IT'S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY / KITTY’S BACK / THUNDERCRACK / YOU MEAN SO MUCH TO ME / GROWIN’ UP / LET THE FOUR WINDS BLOW / ZERO AND BLIND TERRY / BLINDED BY THE LIGHT / FOR YOU / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) - SHOTGUN / TWIST AND SHOUT

One show, double bill, with Springsteen and band headlining and Peter Johnson & The Manic Depressives (Joe’s unofficial house band) opening. Springsteen’s show consisted of two hour-long sets separated by an intermission after "Thundercrack".

The above-mentioned 15-song setlist represents Bruce’s complete show and can be found on the two-CD set ‘Introducing Rosie’ (B Street). The source is an audience recording of only fair quality that contains CB Radio interference.The opening 30 seconds and “Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)” is missing about 20 seconds mid-song, seemingly the result of a tape glitch. There are historical inaccuracies in the liner notes of the ‘Introducing Rosie' CD which have caused confusion over the years. This is not, as stated, the live debut of “Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)”, the song was performed during 1973 and two live recordings from early 1973 are in circulation. However, the song does feature a couple verses of "Shotgun" in the midsection. The CD also incorrectly lists the audio as coming from the January 5 show. Yet comments made by club owner Joe Spadafora prior to “Twist And Shout” offer compelling evidence this recording is from the January 6 show. "For You" is the solo piano version.

A soundboard recording of the final eight songs of this show (the entire second set) had been in very limited circulation since the early 1990s. However, four of these eight soundboard songs surfaced into the wider collector arena on various boots during the mid-late 1990s. The four tracks that surfaced were as follows: #1) “Let The Four Winds Blow” on the CDs ‘The Inner View' and the ‘The Bruce Springsteen Collection, Volume 2'. It was also issued on the CD ‘Play The Tuba And Run’ (which on some specimens had the complete performance but in other cases had a cut version with the final four minutes missing). #2) “Zero And Blind Terry” on the four-CD ‘The Genuine Tracks 1972-1996’. #3) “Twist And Shout” on the CDs ‘The Inner View’ and ‘The Bruce Springsteen Collection, Volume 2’. #4) an edited (the 3-4 minute instrumental intro is missing) 5:59 version of “Blinded By The Light” on the three-CD set ‘Deep Down In The Vaults’ in 1998. The fact that most of these CD boots misidentified the source venue or date created much confusion that still lingers today.

In early 2007 the soundboard of all eight songs in the second set finally surfaced (in excellent quality) into the mainstream collector market via the title ‘Uber Series #21’. This source contains the edited (cut) version of “Blinded By The Light” previously issued on 'Deep Down In The Vaults' (see above). This source is also available on pressed CDs 'Live From Joe's Place' from Godfatherecords and 'Second Set 1974' from Vintage Masters. The soundboard of the opening seven songs of this show (the entire first set) has not surfaced into the mainstream, it allegedly exists in the hands of only a few people.

A claim that one, some, or all three of the Joe’s Place shows were filmed first surfaced in the 1992, second edition Charles Cross/Backstreets book Springsteen: The Man & His Music. That book implied the filming had something to do with a Charity Telethon. Evidence has now emerged (printed in The Real Paper on January 16, 1974) that only one song was recorded on the afternoon of Sunday, January 6, for the benefit of Muscular Dystrophy. This was likely a local fund-raiser, rather than a national telethon. Two takes of "Does This Bus Stop At 82nd Street?" were recorded, without an audience. This was filmed with the intention of showing it on local TV in March, perhaps on a benefit show, but it is unclear whether this ever happened. This recording (perhaps only audio) still exists in private collections, and audio of one of the takes entered circulation in 2017 on the 'Odds & Sods' compilation.

1974-01-19 - STUDENT CENTER BALLROOM, KENT STATE UNIVERSITY, KENT, OH

ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) - SHOTGUN

One show, double bill, held in the sold-out 1,600-seat Student Union Center Ballroom, with Springsteen and band opening for headliner Black Oak Arkansas. Springsteen opened but played about 80 minutes. However the vast majority of the fans in attendance had come to see Black Oak Arkansas, so it was a very raucous audience.

There were continual problems with feedback and echo inside the K.S.U. Ballroom during this show, prompting a scathing review by K.S.U. rock critic Clyde Hadlock following the concert. Hadlock felt that neither band had adequately prepared their sound systems to fit the auditorium's dynamics. According to Hadlock "if the echo had been any worse we could have heard the show twice". Hadlock's review of Springsteen's performance is positive and Hadlock makes no secret of the fact he felt the wrong band was headlining, calling Black Oak Arkansas "a bunch of backward crackers - they are to music what Roller Derby is to TV". Springsteen, on the other hand, he calls "a great poet". Hadlock doesn't articulate Springsteen's setlist in his review. However he gets very detailed about Bruce's final song at this show, "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)". Says Hadlock in his review…"My biggest complaint (about Springsteen) is that he marred his big show-closing piece, "Rosalita", by whipping into Junior Walker's "Shotgun" and then taking ten minutes to introduce the band." This detailed information concerning "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" is just one of many pieces of evidence that proves that the long-circulating soundboard audio assigned to this date is, in fact, not from this show.

A fascinating article on a Kent State blog goes into more detail about the show: Springsteen was paid $750 for the night's work, Black Oak Arkansas took home much more, in the region of $5,000. Following the show Bruce went to a party in a house on campus, sitting on the floor in a torn leather jacket and boots with a hole in.

There is no circulating audio from this show. Please note that the widely circulating soundboard audio attributed to this show (most famously found on the CD "You Mean So Much To Me" (Great Dane) is actually from a small club gig in Nashville ten days later (see listing for January 29 for specific details).

One show, double bill, with Springsteen and band headlining and local outfit Goose Creek Symphony opening. This was a rescheduled show, originally booked for November 30, 1973 at the VCU Gym but postponed. The above-mentioned eight-song setlist is from a circulating audience recording (90 minutes) of only fair quality.

This show and the previous night in Richmond were reviewed by Chris Charlesworth of Melody Maker. He says that "Walking The Dog" was played tonight, and suggests that "New York City Serenade" and "Wild Billy's Circus Story" were also in the set. The other two songs listed above are from the recollections of others present.

One show, double bill, with Springsteen and band opening for headlining Texas blues guitar legend Freddie King (and his band). King was booked for a six-night residency, however Springsteen was a special guest only for the first two nights. Bruce played before King both nights but was allowed to give a headliner-length performance. Bruce's booking at this small, 300-seat club came about after Mike Appel became aware of a CBS Sales Convention taking place in Nashville and, additionally, that the entire CBS contingent would be staying in a hotel near this club. Appel conducted a handbill/leaflet drop to each room in the hotel, inviting nearly 200 CBS sales and marketing people to attend the shows. However, according to Appel, nobody from CBS turned up and the club was painfully empty. The audio evidence certainly backs up Appel's recollection. There doesn't sound like there are more than 100 people in the club for Bruce's show. It is speculated this soundboard was recorded because Appel wanted to have material from the show to give to the CBS people he (wrongly) anticipated would show up. This was a single show consisting of two sets. There was a short intermission after "Thundercrack". The opening song of the second set, "You Mean So Much To Me", is missing its opening minute or so. Similarly "Blinded By The Light" was the final song in the second set and the opening minute of the first encore, "Let The Four Winds Blow", is missing. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" (which contains the "Shotgun" segment) was the final encore.

The above-mentioned ten-song setlist represents Bruce's complete performance and is from an excellent quality soundboard that is most commonly found on the widely circulating CD 'You Mean So Much To Me' (Great Dane). Unfortunately, the folks at Great Dane incorrectly attributed this audio to a January 19 show at Kent State University and this erroneous information has widely propagated ever since. (Please refer to the January 19 Kent State listing for specific details about that show, which took place in a much larger venue before a substantially larger crowd).

One show, double bill, with Springsteen and band opening for headliner Wishbone Ash.

The above-mentioned eight-song setlist is from a circulating audience recording of fair-good quality and represents Springsteen complete 65-minute performance as the evening's undercard. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" incorporates the Junior Walker "Shotgun" segment. An announcer can be heard announcing Wishbone Ash by name, positively linking the audio to this show. Available on the CDR 'Cleveland 74'.

A major snowstorm strikes Springfield the day of the show, and only a handful are one hand to witness the two-hour set. An attendee notes that the horrific weather meant only around 30 people attended the show. The band lost power during the show so Bruce played piano until it returned.

NEW YORK CITY SERENADE / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / GROWIN’ UP / WALKING THE DOG / BLINDED BY THE LIGHT / KITTY’S BACK / FOR YOU / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) - SHOTGUN

One show, double bill, held in the Student Center Ballroom, with Springsteen and band headlining with a 90-minute performance and local blues-rock group The Hatfield Clan opening with a 60-minute performance. The show was not a sellout, only about half of the venue’s 700 tickets were sold. The above-noted setlist (there are likely three or four songs missing) emanates from writer Joel Zakem’s original, glowing, review of the show in the University of Kentucky student newspaper, as well as further details provided to Brucebase by Mr Zakem. Springsteen opened with the extended Sancious-led intro version of "New York City Serenade".

Prior to the start of this show there had been a heated argument/scuffle between road manager Steve Appel (manager Mike Appel’s brother) and drummer Vini Lopez. Springsteen, after discussing the altercation incident with Mike Appel by phone following the show, then asked Lopez to submit his resignation. Consequently this turned out to be Vini's final show with the band. The sudden departure of Lopez would force the cancellation of the trip to Ohio and the next three scheduled shows.

No circulating audio.

1974-02-15 - STUDENT UNION AUDITORIUM, UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO, TOLEDO, OH

Cancelled concert, never rescheduled. This event had been planned to be one show held in the 500-seat Student Union Auditorium, with Springsteen and band the sole act on the bill. The bad news came via a phone call from Mike Appel to the head of the Student Union Concert Board on the early evening of February 14. Appel stated that there had been a sudden, unforeseen departure of Bruce's drummer (Lopez) and that, while a new drummer (Ernest Carter) had already been chosen, rehearsals would be needed before any gigs could be played. The Student Union Board did ask that Springsteen (who was still back east) travel to Ohio and give a solo performance instead, but the request was denied. In a bizarre twist, only a few hours following Appel's phone call a robbery took place in which all the cash takings and unsold tickets for the Springsteen show were specifically targeted and stolen. The cancellation and robbery were not related. The announcement of both the cancellation and the robbery were made on the morning of February 15 in the school's newspaper.

Audio from The Agora radio broadcast of June 3 is often incorrectly attributed to this cancelled gig.

1974-02-23 - SATELLITE LOUNGE, COOKSTOWN, NJ

ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT)

No other setlist details known. One show, with Springsteen and band the sole act on the bill at this notorious watering hole for military personnel from Fort Dix. This was the debut gig for drummer Ernest 'Boom' Carter, who was a childhood friend of Davey Sancious. As had been the case with the three previous scheduled shows in Ohio, Springsteen had directed Mike Appel to cancel or reschedule this gig, as Carter had only arrived in New Jersey (from Atlanta after a call from Sancious) a few days earlier and had only managed one till-dawn rehearsal with the band. However, under threat of retribution from Satellite Lounge owner Carlo Rossi, Bruce agreed to play. This was a long show that incorporated two very unusual 70 - 80 minute sets, with the opening set not starting until after midnight. There was then a long intermission, with the second set not starting until after 3.00am. Since Carter had not had the opportunity to learn Springsteen's compositions this performance incorporated a uniquely high proportion of classic rock standards, material that Carter already knew. In Mike Appel's words, "one of those amazing nights where everything worked and not a soul knew that Carter was a new drummer". Bruce recounted some hilarious details about this gig a couple of weeks later during a Texas radio interview (see the March 8 KLOL-FM listing).

A contributor to the Greasy Lake website had this to say about the show: "I was there. Bruce and his band were in the center of the stage ~ the "dance floor" was on either side of the band. I was up there dancing with my boyfriend. The band jumped into a rousing, jagged version of "Rosalita." In the middle of the song, during the instrumental break, Bruce swung his guitar around to his back, leaned over, and grabbed my arm. I danced my heart out with Bruce!"

Unfortunately, there is no known audio from this show.

1974-02-25 - THE MAIN POINT, BRYN MAWR, PA

WILD BILLY'S CIRCUS STORY / WALKING THE DOG / TOKYO / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT)

One show, 8.00pm, with Springsteen and band the sole act on the bill. The partial setlist above is from an attendee recollection. This final night of Springsteen's two-night stint at The Main Point was nearly cancelled, as Bruce had come down with a bad case of influenza and could barely function. A Brucebase reader who attended the final show confirmed this story, commenting: "he had a fever of 101 and sat in a chair all night, except for "Rosalita", even sitting down he was the best I ever saw!"

There is no circulating audio.

Cancelled concert (due to Bruce being ill), never rescheduled. This concert was originally scheduled as two shows, double billing, with Springsteen and band opening for Richie Havens. In his review of the later Georgetown show, critic Jerry Gilbert mentions that Springsteen has a bad cough and is coughing up blood and this is the reason for the cancellation of this show.

1974-03-03 - GASTON HALL, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY, WASHINGTON, DC

Soundcheck: includes SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT

Early (first) show: WILD BILLY'S CIRCUS STORY / INCIDENT ON 57TH STREET / NEW YORK CITY SERENADE / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / THE E STREET SHUFFLE / WALKING THE DOG / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) / BLINDED BY THE LIGHT / KITTY'S BACK / FOR YOU / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT)

Late (second) show: WILD BILLY'S CIRCUS STORY (5.30) / NEW YORK CITY SERENADE (15.00) / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT (5.57) / THE E STREET SHUFFLE - HAVING A PARTY (5.16) / WALKING THE DOG (14.44) / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) (6.22) / IT'S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY (4.01) / KITTY'S BACK (10.59) / FOR YOU (9.28) / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) (9.03) / LET THE FOUR WINDS BLOW

Two shows, 7:30pm and 10:30pm, with Springsteen and band headlining and Orleans opening. Held in the sold-out, 750-seat Gaston Hall. A copy of the concert contract signed by Steve Appel (Mike's brother, and the band's road manager) indicates that the original plan was for one show (8pm) in the much larger McDonough Arena, scheduled for February 25. These details were crossed out and amended before the contract was signed. Springsteen's fee for appearing was $1500. Click the link above to view the contract. Critic Jerry Gilbert attended both shows and wrote a lengthy, highly detailed review of the night's events that appeared a couple of weeks later in Sounds magazine. The above-mentioned eleven-song setlist for the first show is likely to be complete and includes all seven of the songs from The Wild, The Innocent And The E Street Shuffle album, the only known time that happened (until 2009, at least), although it probably had occurred before due to the amount of undocumented setlists from this era. Paul confirmed that "Walking The Dog" and the solo piano "For You" were played at the early show. Paul also notes that Bruce spoke about the shows with NRBQ in Atlanta in early February and highly recommended seeing them.

Intriguingly critic Jerry Gilbert (who clearly notes “Let The Four Winds Blow” as ending the second show) mentions that following the second show Springsteen sat down at a piano backstage and played him (plus Mike Appel and some of the band members) a brand new song that he'd recently written, unfortunately, Gilbert doesn't mention the song’s title. "Walking The Dog" includes Dave Sancious playing a bit of "Mary Had A Little Lamb" during his solo. Last known performance of "4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)" with the original album third verse "waitress" lyrics until 2005. By the next performance of the song in April 1974, Springsteen had rewritten the third verse to the "angels" lyrics. "For You" is the solo piano version.

There is no known audio of the early show. Springsteen's eleven-song late (second) show was simulcast (minus "Let The Four Winds Blow") on the University’s popular radio station WGTB-FM. It can be found in excellent soundboard quality on several different boots such as 'Saint In The City' (Swingin' Pig), 'NYC Serenade' (Oil Well), 'The Boss Keeps Rockin, Vol 3' (Imtrat) and to retail in the UK on CD 'Saint In The City' (Rox Vox). A highlight of this broadcast is a wonderful "New York City Serenade". It is unknown if the lengthy final encore, "Let The Four Winds Blow", was taped or not, it definitely was not broadcast that night (probably due to a 90-minute schedule restriction) and that piece of audio has never circulated among collectors.

1974-03-07 - LIBERTY HALL, HOUSTON, TX

WALKING THE DOG

No other set details known. One show, 8.00pm, with Springsteen and band headlining and singer-songwriter Jimmy Spheeris opening. This is Thursday and opening night of what would be a four-day (seven-show) residency at the 300-seat Liberty Hall. On this evening most (possibly all) of Springsteen's show is broadcast by radio station KPFT-FM as part of its 'every Thursday night' broadcast segment from Liberty Hall. A complimentary review in the Houston Chronicle does mention that "Walking The Dog" was performed, but no other details of the night's setlist are articulated.

As incredible and unlikely as it may seem, there is no circulating audio from this night's show, making this the only verified Springsteen radio broadcast that has yet to surface. It does not appear that any of the later KPFT-FM 'compilation' re-broadcasts of live material from Liberty Hall included any of the material from this show.

1974-03-08 - RADIO STATION KLOL-FM, HOUSTON, TX

SPRINGSTEEN INTERVIEW & CHAT (18:26)

An interesting discussion with KLOL-FM DJ Ed Beauchamp held during the afternoon at the station and broadcast live. Bruce did not perform any songs. Bruce returned to KLOL with the entire band the following afternoon for an in-station performance. Some selections from the March 9 KLOL show are sometimes incorrectly attributed to this show.

The interview can be found complete on the CD boot 'The Lost Radio Show' (Whoopy Cat), although the CD mistakenly lists it as taking place the following day. As there has been confusion about the date, location and other aspects of this show, some relevant points should be pointed out. During the interview Beauchamp mentions the station’s frequency (101), thereby confirming it as KLOL-FM. Comments made during the discussion positively confirm the show as being on the March 8 and also confirm that no other Springsteen band members are present.

1974-03-08 - LIBERTY HALL, HOUSTON, TX

No set details known. Two shows, 8.00pm and 11.00pm, double bill, with Springsteen and band headlining and singer-songwriter Jimmy Spheeris opening. At the following day's interview, it is mentioned that a streaker ran behind Springsteen at this show while he was performing.

There is no circulating audio from this night's shows.

1974-03-09 - RADIO STATION KLOL-FM, HOUSTON, TX

Soundcheck: SATIN DOLL - BEER BARREL POLKA (2:34)

SATIN DOLL (2:30) / DOES THIS BUS STOP AT 82ND STREET? (5:56) / GROWIN' UP (10:17) / MARY QUEEN OF ARKANSAS (6:53) / WILD BILLY'S CIRCUS STORY (5:30) / SENTIMENTAL JOURNEY (3:05) / THE FEVER (8:49) / SOMETHING YOU GOT - HEAT WAVE (7:12)

The above-mentioned setlist represents the complete performance by Bruce and band inside a recording studio, KLOL-FM. This is lengthiest of all Bruce's radio station sojourns; in fact, this is practically a concert in itself. A stunning "The Fever" is performed because a studio demo of the song (later issued on the official Columbia 1998 release Tracks) had been sent to the station by Mike Appel a couple of months earlier and had been receiving strong phone-in requests. The entire show can be found in excellent quality on the CD 'The Lost Radio Show' from various labels including Whoopy Cat, Kiss The Stone, Postscript and Audifon. The two reels used for 'The Lost Radio Show' were rescued from the trash after KLOL were purging their tape library. Before they were bootlegged by Whoopy Cat, the reels were offered to Springsteen's people, but they declined. Released to retail in the UK on CD 'Sentimental Journey' (Broadcasting Radio Records). The so-called intro/tuning includes parts of "Satin Doll" and “Beer Barrel Polka". Comments made during this show positively confirm the stations as KLOL-FM and the recording and broadcast date as the afternoon of March 9.

1974-03-09 - LIBERTY HALL, HOUSTON, TX

Late (second) show: WILD BILLY'S CIRCUS STORY (9:53) / NEW YORK CITY SERENADE (14:45) / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT (5:32) / WALKING THE DOG (15:54) / IT’S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY (4:15) / THE E STREET SHUFFLE - HAVING A PARTY (5:11) / BLINDED BY THE LIGHT (10:20) / FOR YOU (10:36) / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) (10:14)

Two shows, double bill, with Springsteen and band headlining and Jimmie Spheeris opening. Prior to "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" someone in the crowd requests “The Fever” - Bruce doesn't perform it at this show but promises the crowd that he’ll work up a band arrangement and play it the next time he is in Houston. It seems Bruce accelerated that promise, as he surprises everyone by performing a semi-band version at the late show the following night. "For You" is the solo piano version.

Even though there are only nine songs in this setlist, most of the performances during this show are quite extended versions. With a running time of about 90 minutes (depending on between-song edits) this is most likely the complete show, although there are edit points between some songs so it is possible that a couple of additional songs were performed but are not circulating. Comments Springsteen makes during the show relating to his March 9 afternoon in-station acoustic performance at KLOL-FM prove this audio is also from March 9. Other comments made by Bruce strongly point to this being the second show on March 9.

There is still confusion about whether this night’s show was simulcast live by KLOL-FM or whether the show was taped only for later use. Current evidence suggests this show wasn’t simulcast but instead was first broadcast in November 1974 to promote Springsteen’s later Texas tour. There is also some evidence that the material was broadcast disjointed in November of 1974, rather than in one continuous program segment.

There is no circulating audio from this first (early) show. The above-mentioned nine-song setlist for the late show (believed to be in the proper sequence) is taken from circulating audio that has been sourced from home tapings of radio broadcasts. All nine recordings can be found on the two-CD boot 'Liberty Hall' (Mistral) and 'The Complete Liberty Hall Tapes' (Burning Love). The original tapers utilized modest recording equipment, so the sound quality is good but not brilliant.

1974-03-10 - LIBERTY HALL, HOUSTON, TX

Early (first) show: WILD BILLY’S CIRCUS STORY / NEW YORK CITY SERENADE

Late (second) show: MARY QUEEN OF ARKANSAS (5:29) / THE FEVER (9:48) / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT (5:30) / GIMME THAT WINE (3:02) / THE E STREET SHUFFLE (4:16) / SOMETHING YOU GOT (5:28) / IT'S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY (4:25) / DOES THIS BUS STOP AT 82ND STREET? (3:32) / KITTY'S BACK (8:57) / ANGEL'S BLUES (8:08) / THUNDERCRACK (13:45) / FOR YOU (7:54) / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) (end cut, 0:45)

Two shows (8.00pm and 11.00pm), double bill, with Springsteen and band headlining and Jimmy Spheeris opening. As advertising for the Liberty Hall residency states, the final night was originally scheduled as one show only. However due to strong demand a second (late) show was added at the very last moment. Attendee recollections from March 10 that have surfaced over the years have caused great confusion due to the fact that both shows featured somewhat different setlists and because it was not generally known/confirmed that two shows were performed on March 10. Springsteen opened the first show of this night with an acoustic "Wild Billy's Circus Story" and a partial band, acoustic-orientated rendition of "New York City Serenade" (the same two songs he had opened the second show with the previous night). The remaining songs performed during this first show are still unclear. For the second show Bruce changed the two opening songs, instead, he began the late show with an acoustic "Mary Queen of Arkansas" followed by a semi-acoustic "The Fever".

The second show has several interesting features. Springsteen sings the "The Fever" for the first time in a concert setting and predicates the rendition by mentioning the studio demo that has been sent out to some radio stations (but doesn't mention the fact he played the song the day before inside the KLOL-FM studio). By performing "The Fever" at this show Bruce appears to have been delivering on a promise he made to the Liberty Hall audience the night before. Additionally, Bruce breaks a guitar string during "Spirit In The Night" and so we get the first known rendition of Clarence's time-filling comedy number "Gimme That Wine". We're also treated to the only known live performance of "Angel's Blues" (known to most fans by the titles of "She's So Fine" and "Ride On Sweet William") a rather unspectacular song that dates from mid-1973. The performance is very ragged, indicating it may not have been rehearsed much. "For You" is the solo piano version.

No audio of the early show is known to exist. The above-mentioned thirteen-song setlist for the late show (believed to be in the proper sequence) is taken from audio that has been sourced from home tapings of radio broadcasts. Current evidence suggests this show was not simulcast live at the time but, rather, was first broadcast in November 1974 to promote Springsteen’s later Texas tour. There is also some evidence that the material was broadcast in bits and pieces in November 1974, rather than in one complete program segment. The original taper's utilized modest recording equipment, so the sound quality is good but not outstanding. With a running time of about 98 minutes (depending on between-song edits) this is most likely the complete show, although it is possible that a couple of songs are missing. Comments Springsteen makes between several songs offer quite compelling evidence all this audio is from the late show on March 10.

The thirteen songs that are known from the late show only appeared coherently on a mainstream bootleg in 2009. The CD boots 'Liberty Hall' (Mistral), 'All Those Years' (Templar) and 'Live & Unreleased' (Seagull) each include the same five recordings ("Mary Queen of Arkansas", "The Fever", "Gimme That Wine", "Angel's Blues" and "Thundercrack"). 'Liberty Hall' also includes "Something You Got". 'All Those Years' and 'Live & Unreleased' also includes "The E Street Shuffle". The six 'rare/missing' recordings ("Spirit In The Night", "It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City", "Does This Bus Stop At 82nd Street?", "Kitty's Back", "For You" and "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)") are available on CD 'Greetings From Liberty Hall TX' (Wonderland Records). The full show is also included in the set also featuring the prior night's radio broadcast 'The Complete Liberty Hall Tapes' (Burning Love). The audio quality of this CD is somewhat different to the old versions - it appears to be sourced from a alternative recording. It should also be noted that there are unsubstantiated reports that this second show included two additional songs ("4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)" and "Let The Four Winds Blow") that don't seem to be circulating anywhere.

1974-03-15 - ARMADILLO WORLD HEADQUARTERS, AUSTIN, TX

ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / BLINDED BY THE LIGHT / TWIST AND SHOUT / LET THE FOUR WINDS BLOW

One show, with Springsteen and band headlining a capacity crowd of 1,500 and western swing band Alvin Crow & The Pleasant Valley Boys opening. Partial setlist details above are from attendee recollections. This was Bruce and the boys first-ever gig in Austin and both Springsteen and Appel were concerned about a potential clash of musical (and audience) styles between the two acts. The concern proved unfounded, as Bruce recounted during a 1980 interview in 'Performance Magazine', "It worried me a little bit. I knew for sure we weren't cowboys and I didn't know how they (the audience) would act. But, you know, they were up and dancing by the second song. I didn't think there were people like that, able to shift from one extreme to another so quickly".

Two Brucebase readers who attended recall "It was a special weekend show so it was a whopping $1.50 to get in! It ended being the best show I ever saw, period. I remember there were four encores and the last song he played was 'Let The Four Winds Blow' and he yelled out 'somebody get me a cheeseburger' at the end. We ran down Guadalupe Street and ate lots of tacos to recoup our energy". "We were really blown away that night. From the minute the music started everyone was on their feet, dancing and screaming and holding hands. I had never seen such a tight band before, or since. Bruce was jumping up on everything, speakers, pianos, you name it."

There is no audio in circulation.

NEW YORK CITY SERENADE / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / THE FEVER / WALKING THE DOG / THUNDERCRACK / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / LET THE FOUR WINDS BLOW / TWIST AND SHOUT

One show, with Springsteen and band headlining and western swing band Alvin Crow & The Pleasant Valley Boys opening. Partial setlist details above are from a 1974 article/review in Rolling Stone magazine (click above link to read). An online blog has noted three further songs that were played - "The Fever", "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)", and "Thundercrack".

1974-03-18 - GERTIE'S, DALLAS, TX

WALKING THE DOG

No other set details known. Two shows, with Springsteen and band the sole act on the bill. Opening of a four-night (eight-show) residency. This series of gigs was originally scheduled for a smaller club in Dallas called Mother Blues. However due to the rapturous reception and strong ticket sales that had occurred at the gigs in Houston and Austin, it was decided at the last moment to shift the residency to the larger Gertie’s venue. The decision turned out to be unnecessary, as ticket sales in Dallas were very poor, with only 50 to 75 people present at most of the shows, an indication of just how dramatically Bruce’s popularity varied from city to city at this point in his career.

Brucebase reader Gary Mcgill attended the show and was kind enough to send us his recollections: "Gertie's was the sister club to Mother Blues and were both on Lemmon Avenue a few blocks apart. I was 18, living in an old house a few blocks away. I had no knowledge of Bruce Springsteen at the time, but often went to Gertie's and Mother Blues. We'd see local bands like the Werewolves, Freddie King, Stevie Ray Vaughn when just starting out, Jonny Nitzinger (blues guitarist and author of some Bloodrock songs) and touring bands like Brian Auger's Oblivion Express, Ray Manzarek band (of the Doors), Tim Buckley, and many others. A friend from Austin told me I simply had to go see this guy Bruce Springsteen. He'd just played the Armadillo World Headquarters in Austin and my friend was amazed. So I went to the show at Gertie's (I just paid admission at the door....don't recall but it couldn't have been more than $2 or $3). I was on my own. My roommate worked the night shift and couldn't go to the show. Only 50 or 60 people in the entire club (and the club wasn't that big). I don't really recall two shows. I do know they did a set, then a long break, then another set. During the break, I stood at the bar and talked to (I think) Garry Tallent for quite a while. We chatted about Austin, The Armadillo, etc. Very nice fellow. Bruce and most of the band was outside.

I recall thinking in the second set that maybe they didn't know many songs because they played a lot of things again. In retrospect that could have been because it was supposed to be two shows. I think the club management just let us all stay because the place was so empty. The stage at Gertie's is not very big and only a couple of feet taller than the floor in the place. Plus the ceiling is very low. I recall the band seeming a bit cramped on the stage. I also recall vividly that Bruce and band were playing as if they were in Madison Square Garden....putting on a hell of a show for even our small audience. And everyone there was loving it. Seems like the last song they played was a long cover of "Walking The Dog" with Bruce going wild on stage, totally sweat drenched.

I've been to many hundreds of concerts, starting back in 1968 and seen almost every major rock act, particularly the late 60s and 70s. Still attend many concerts every year, but the Bruce Springsteen and E-Street Band show in that little club, Gertie's, is still one of my all time best concert experiences."

One show, double bill, with Springsteen headlining and Wendy Waldman opening. This was Bruce’s first-ever experience performing on a revolving stage (he would spin again on July 27 and February 23, 1975). The above-mentioned 11-song setlist (believed to encompass the entire performance) is culled from a review of the concert that appeared in the Arizona State University paper.

No known audio. The CDR 'Walking The Dog In Phoenix' claims to feature a recording of this show, in fact this is merely a poor quality copy of the March 3, 1974 radio broadcast from Georgetown University. It has been suggested that an poor quality audience recording of this show does exist, but we can find no concrete evidence for this. If you know more, please get in touch. "For You" is likely to be the solo piano version. Also from this night is an outstanding 40-minute discussion with Bruce (and Mike Appel in spots) that took place backstage after the show with reporters from The Phoenix New Times and Arizona State University. This is the most interesting interview with Springsteen available in any media format from the pre-Born to Run era, loaded with details about early shows and sessions.

NEW YORK CITY SERENADE / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / KITTY'S BACK / FOR YOU / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT)

One show, double bill, held in the sold-out 550-seat MacMorland Center, with Springsteen and band headlining and slide guitar virtuoso Ellen McIlwaine opening with a 60-minute set. Springsteen is introduced by Widener College emcee Murray the K. The above-mentioned partial setlist details are from reviews in the school newspapers of Widener College and Villanova University - click the link above to read both. The review in The Villanovan is particularly caustic about the "loud, drunk and obnoxious" Widener College crowd, perhaps to be expected from a fellow Pennsylvania school. The concert started 70 minutes late due to the late arrival of the Springsteen camp but Bruce made up for it with a stellar, 1¾ hour performance. The show opens with "New York City Serenade", while "For You" is performed with Bruce alone at the piano. This is the infamous 'gangster hat show' where Bruce abandoned his ever-faithful beret in favour of a 'Bonnie & Clyde' style fedora, he told a student reporter after the show he'd acquired this during his recent Texas tour.

One show, double bill, with Springsteen and band headlining and The Persuasions opening. The above-mentioned nine-song partial setlist is from an attendee recollection that is deemed reliable. There was about a 90-minute performance by Springsteen, so there are three or four songs missing from this list. Brucebase has received feedback that “Born to Run” may have been given a tryout performance at this show, but the evidence is hazy at this point.

There is no known audio from this show.

1974-04-07 - BISHOP DOUGHERTY STUDENT CENTER, SETON HALL UNIVERSITY, SOUTH ORANGE, NJ

No set details known. One show, double bill, with Bruce and band headlining. Held in the Main Lounge of the Bishop Dougherty Student Center and promoted as a dance concert, no chairs, people were told to bring their own blankets to sit on! The undercard was local outfit The Jim Marino Band (featuring Seton Hall University student Max Weinberg on drums). Max has commented that he first met Bruce (very briefly) immediately following this show, when Max went up to Bruce and told him how much he enjoyed his performance. As fate would have it Max would end up auditioning and landing the drummer position in The E Street Band in August 1974.

Yet another radio broadcast acoustic show by Bruce and the band (minus 'Boom' Carter). Unquestionably the highlight of this show is the unique acoustic performance of "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)", a genuine 'must have' track that you can hear by clicking the link above. "4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)" features the first known performance of the rewritten "angels" third verse. The song will continue to be played with these lyrics until 2005, when Springsteen reverted to the original album "waitress" lyric.

The above-mentioned setlist represents the entire performance and can be found in excellent broadcast quality on the CD 'Radio Waves' (Great Dane Records).

Early (first) show: NEW YORK CITY SERENADE / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / WALKING THE DOG / KITTY’S BACK / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT)

Two shows, double bill, with Springsteen and band headlining and blues singer Mighty Joe Young opening. Both artists had originally been scheduled to play separate, single show residencies at nearby Joe's Place (note the ill-fated Joe's Place above). However a fire destroyed Joe's Place on April 2 and both artists quickly agreed to perform an adjusted double-billing schedule together at Charlie's (four nights, eight shows). It should be noted that although Springsteen increased the number of shows from three (as planned at Joe's) to eight (at Charlie's), the length of Bruce's performances at Charlie's were only 80 to 90 minutes, whereas the Joe's Place shows would have been two hours or more. There is no available audio from this show. A partial setlist from the early show is known via a gig review that appeared in a local paper.

Early (first) show: NEW YORK CITY SERENADE / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / FOR YOU / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT)

Late (second) show: NEW YORK CITY SERENADE / LET THE FOUR WINDS BLOW

Two shows, double bill, with Springsteen and band headlining and Mighty Joe Young opening. The partial setlist from the early show is courtesy of a Brucebase reader's confident recollection, who additionally notes: "I was there for the early show. He told a story about stopping in to see Junior Walker at Paul's Mall after his own show the night before, and then later stopping into some deli to get a meatball sub and finding they used flat meatballs!". Springsteen met his future manager-producer Jon Landau for the first time on this night. Landau had arrived to see the second (late) show and spotted Bruce alone on the sidewalk between shows, reading Landau's Real Paper review of the WIESS album, it’d been posted by Charlie’s management on a wall near the club’s entrance. The partial setlist from the late show (the opening number and the second encore) is from Landau’s recollection as conveyed to writer Dave Marsh.

There is no known audio from either show.

1974-04-12 - CHARLIE'S PLACE, CAMBRIDGE, MA

No set details known. Two shows, double bill, with Springsteen and band headlining and blues singer Mighty Joe Young opening. The profits for all eight shows at Charlie's were used to help rebuild Joe's Place. Additionally both Springsteen and Mighty Joe Young donated their performance fees for this final night to The Joe's Place Disaster Fund.

Various resequenced permutations of the audience taped performance from Joe's Place on January 6 are circulating among collectors and are incorrectly attributed to either this or one of the previous nights shows at Charlie's Place. In reality there is currently no circulating audio from any of the 8 Charlie's Place shows from this April 9 to 12 residency.

1974-04-18 - ALUMNI GYMNASIUM, MONMOUTH COLLEGE, WEST LONG BRANCH, NJ

One show, held in the Alumni (Memorial) Gym. Although this gig is noted in the Appel/Columbia Records tour itinerary files, it may have been very hastily arranged, as the school’s student newspaper archive reveals it was not pre-advertised or otherwise mentioned in that paper. Although it was long-thought that the band were the sole act on the bill one attendee remembers the support being Richard Bamberger.

1974-04-19 - STATE THEATRE, NEW BRUNSWICK, NJ

WILD BILLY'S CIRCUS STORY / FOR YOU

No other set details known. One show, double bill, with Springsteen and band headlining and folk stylist Jae Mason opening. This concert went virtually unadvertised by its promoter, who gambled that 'word-of-mouth' would be enough to fill the modest, 550-seat venue. Big mistake, as only about 250 people attended. A New Jersey local from this time has commented "nobody knew this show was happening, in fact even students at Rutgers (in New Brunswick) were totally in the dark until after the fact". Gary, sent in his recollections: "My future wife and I sat in the upstairs balcony right behind the extended Federici family which included at least one of his parents, wife and kid. Great people. Bruce opened his set with the following (paraphrasing here): "thanks to Jae Mason for a great opening set and while we don't do a lot of country music (Mason's style was sort of country folk) the closest thing we have is this and thought we would dedicate it to him". He then did "Wild Billy's Circus Story" with I seem to recall Danny on accordion. The other set change up I recall vs the many many other shows I saw from those days was a slowed down version of "For You" with just Bruce and the piano." Journalist Penn Jillette, who attended this gig, has commented that despite the poor turnout Bruce played with the same intensity as if it were a full house at Madison Square Garden.

1974-04-20 - HELFFERICH HALL, URSINUS COLLEGE, COLLEGEVILLE, PA

No set details known. One show, with Springsteen and band headlining. Support act was female folk stylist Perry Barber, who performed a brief, 35-minute solo set. Although Springsteen played for nearly two hours, the show was halted before the final encores when school officials became concerned that people in the audience lighting matches posed a fire threat to Helfferich Hall. Despite the disappointing finish the school's newspaper called Springsteen's performance "the greatest night in the history of Ursinus College".

1974-04-26 - ALUMNAE HALL, BROWN UNIVERSITY, PROVIDENCE, RI

NEW YORK CITY SERENADE / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / IT’S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY / THE E STREET SHUFFLE / GROWIN’ UP / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) / KITTY’S BACK / FOR YOU / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) - SHOTGUN / BOOM BOOM / TWIST AND SHOUT

One show, 12.00am (midnight, so technically speaking it was held on the 27th), with Springsteen and band the sole act on the bill. Held in the school’s sold-out Alumnae Hall on the Pembroke campus as part of Spring Carnival. There was no delay to the start of the show, as it had always been planned for midnight, a weird starting time given that Bruce was the only act on the bill. By all accounts a highly energized 1¾ hr performance that saw Bruce running amuck in the audience at one point and then undertake his James Brown-influenced “fainting-revival by the band” skit during the final song. The show included an early rendition of John Lee Hooker's “Boom Boom”, although the tune may have actually formed part of the "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight) - Shotgun" combination.

The above-mentioned setlist details (probably complete and in the correct sequence) are garnered from two fine reviews of the show, one by journalist Ty Davis in the Providence Journal and the other by student reporter J. Garrett Andrews in the Brown Herald. Andrews, who hailed from the Asbury Park area, procured a backstage interview with Bruce immediately following the show that was published in the school newspaper the following week - click the link above to read. During this 2:00am interview it’s noted that Bruce has a daytime gig in Connecticut coming up in just 11 hours (1.00pm) and then an early evening (7.00pm) gig at another location right after it. Interestingly, this show did not include any (at that time) unissued Springsteen compositions (i.e. "Thundercrack", "Zero And Blind Terry", "You Mean So Much To Me", etc.), a point not unnoticed by reporter Andrews, who queried Bruce on the matter. Bruce responds by stating the show setlist is in a transitional stage, he’s just written some new songs that he’s about to start incorporating into upcoming shows. It’s likely that Bruce was referring here to the new compositions he performed two weeks later at the Harvard Square Theatre. Bruce also mentions a desire to perform in England - which would come to pass some 18 months after the interview.

There is no circulating audio from this show.

1974-04-27 - ICE HOCKEY ARENA PARKING LOT, UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT, STORRS, CT

No set details known. One show (a four-artist Spring Carnival Extravaganza), held outdoors in the parking lot of the school’s Ice Hockey Arena from 1.00pm - 6.00pm. Springsteen was topped-billed but actually opened the show, seeming in order to be able to make it on time to another booked spring carnival show later that evening 60 kilometers away at the University Of Hartford (see following listing). All four bands played about 90 minute sets and it was an outstanding bill, with funk masters Fatback, Fairport Convention and the always-hot-in-concert Aerosmith (who closed the festivities). And to top it off the whole event was free, including food and drink!

1974-04-27 - GYMNASIUM, UNIVERSITY OF HARTFORD, HARTFORD, CT

No set details known. One show, with Springsteen and band opening for The Chambers Brothers and headliners Mountain. The boys had already performed a full show earlier in the day at the University of Connecticut. That outdoor gig had been long planned but this indoor gig held in the UH Gymnasium was a late addition to the tour itinerary, with Bruce agreeing to replace the Elvin Bishop Band, who'd cancelled the week before. According to Kevin Fahey, who was head of the UH Program Council at the time, Springsteen was paid $1,250 for his night's work. Marty Schlesinger was a student at UH at the time and recalls, "I played on the UH Lacrosse team at the time and Bruce and the band came into our locker room as we were changing after practice. They were using the locker room as their dressing room. Pretty cool group of guys who freely interacted with us. Clarence Clemons pulled out his sax (on Bruce's urging) and played some riffs in the locker room shower. Pretty impressive echo acoustics." Apparently Mountain's Leslie West enjoyed the show from the front row, but The Chambers Brothers didn't want to come on after Bruce's set.

There is no known audio from this gig. Unfortunately there is unofficial audio trading among collectors from a rogue broadcast by a daring DJ at Hartford radio station WHCN-FM in the late 70s. This audio is falsely labelled in some tape trading circles as being from this 1974 show. It's not. It's all from very common bootleg sources. “Kitty’s Back” emanates from the July 13 show and both “Growin’ Up” and “It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City” are from the April 17, 1976 show. To make matters even more confusing there is a performance of “Growin’ Up” circulating that's alleged to be from an in-station solo acoustic performance by Bruce at WHCH-FM prior to this Hartford show. There was no such in-station performance, it turns out that this is merely the John Hammond studio demo.

1974-04-28 - SCOTT AMPHITHEATER, SWARTHMORE COLLEGE, SWARTHMORE, PA

DOES THIS BUS STOP AT 82ND STREET? / KITTY'S BACK / BLINDED BY THE LIGHT / GIMME THAT WINE / BORN TO RUN

No other set details known. The first four tracks above are from attendee recollections. One afternoon outdoor show, double bill, with Springsteen an band headlining and acoustic outfit Wire And Wood (Frank Collins, Craig Bickhardt and Rick Bell) opening. According to the school's newspaper if the weather was poor this show was to be held indoors (in Clothier Building Auditorium) but if the weather was fine it would be held outdoors in the school’s small, stunningly beautiful Scott Amphitheater. Perfect, unseasonably warm weather prevailed so the concert was held outdoors in front of an audience of less than 300 lucky patrons. Apparently the quaint, picturesque atmosphere elicited a particularly jazzy performance by Bruce and the band. Mike Appel has stated that Springsteen planned to perform "Born To Run" at the college. If accurate, this would constitute the earliest performance of the song. Swarthmore was an co-ed school but Philadelphia Inquirer critic Bill Mandel, who attended this show, described Bruce and the band as performing "to a glade-full of barely clad satyrs and nymphs who writhed and danced in and out of the trees." Jim recalls: "The show was electrifying, and the crowd hung on every note. I'll never forget the audible gasps from the crowd when the band and the Boss tore through the stop-time part of 'Does this Bus Stop at 82nd Street?' The tiny amphitheater audience was hot, sweaty and completely enthralled." Another recollection, this time from Michael: "The most unbelievable part of the show was that it was absolutely free with only 90 folks tops in attendance! My favorite recollections were a ridiculously long version of "Kitty's Back", the only time I witnessed 'The Song With the Funky Break' ("Blinded By The Light") and the only lead vocal by Clarence that I ever saw, ripping into a tune called "Gimme That Wine"." John, a Swarthmore graduate informed Brucebase that the College is (and was) not, in fact, an all-girls school.

1974-04-29 - ROXY THEATER, NORTHAMPTON, PA

ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT)

No other set details known. Two shows, 7:30pm and 10.00pm, with Springsteen and band the sole act on the bill. Both shows were sellouts. Promoted and sponsored by WSAN-AM in Allentown, however there was no radio broadcast of either show. This was Bruce's only appearance at this 600-seat, classically designed art deco former vaudeville/movie theater. The theater showed movies at the weekend and rock concerts during the week, sponsored by the underground AM station. There were no FM stations in this area (east Pennsylvania) at the time. Also appearing at the theater around the same time were Billy Joel, Al Stewart, John Hartford and the Strawbs. Entrance fee for Springsteen was $2.00. Brucebase reader Richard also writes his memories: "First he wore a floppy hat, which he moved all over his head, almost as a prop. And the second was the incredible encore of Rosalita which was amazing. I did not know the song (or any Bruce songs at that time). My friend who went with me was from Jersey and had heard of him, so we splurged for the two bucks. AND, I have been a huge fan ever since. Right after the show, I borrowed the first two albums and recorded them on my reel-to-reel tape recorder, and that started my collection (hundreds of boots since then)."

NEW YORK CITY SERENADE / GROWIN' UP / IT'S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY / KITTY'S BACK / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / LET THE FOUR WINDS BLOW

One show, double bill, with Springsteen and band headlining and Buzzy Linhart opening. Being a part of the school's Spring Carnival '74 itinerary the free concert had an unusual schedule, with Linhart performing a 90-minute show starting at 6.00pm, then a three-hour break before Springsteen took the stage at 11.00pm. Bruce's performance lasted just under two hours. A pre-show article in the school newspaper The Montclarion mentions a press release that describes Bruce as "a good Catholic boy from New Jersey". A Brucebase reader who attended comments: "the most memorable thing about the show was the beginning. The stage was totally dark and then as the lights slowly came up, like an early gray dawn, they played a long intro to "New York City Serenade" while the band members remained motionless like mannequins, like ghostly shadows, one of the two or three best shows I have ever seen". There is no circulating audio from this show.

1974-05-06 - GYMNASIUM, BUCKS COUNTY COMMUNITY COLLEGE, NEWTOWN, PA

SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT

No other setlist details known. One show, double bill, with Springsteen and band headlining and jazz fusion outfit Return To Forever (featuring Chick Corea) opening. A Brucebase reader comments: "I got there early and found each member of Return To Forever practicing separately in a hallway surrounding the gym the show was held in. Stanley Clark was playing bass in the band then". A contributor to songfacts.com recalls that "Spirit In The Night" was played.

1974-05-09 - HARVARD SQUARE THEATRE, CAMBRIDGE, MA

Soundcheck: THE E STREET SHUFFLE / DOES THIS BUS STOP AT 82ND STREET?

Early (first) show: NEW YORK CITY SERENADE (13:44) / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT (5:26) / I SOLD MY HEART TO THE JUNKMAN (5:09) / DOES THIS BUS STOP AT 82ND STREET? (3:47) / IT'S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY (4:01) / THE E STREET SHUFFLE - HAVING A PARTY (6:00) / KITTY'S BACK (13:28) / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) (9:34)

Late (second) show: THE E STREET SHUFFLE / NEW YORK CITY SERENADE / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / BORN TO RUN / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) / IT'S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY / KITTY'S BACK / FOR YOU / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / LET THE FOUR WINDS BLOW / TWIST AND SHOUT

Two shows, double bill, with Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band opening for headliner Bonnie Raitt. This is one of most famous Springsteen gigs yet, ironically, one of the most inaccurately reported - the key point of confusion being that there were two separate admission shows on the night and the long-circulating audio has been long-attributed to the wrong show. An excellent show that includes a unique cover of the Dinah Washington / Etta James WWII-era blues classic "I Sold My Heart To The Junkman" (performed by Bruce in the 'comedy mode' as recorded by The Starlets in 1961, the likely inspiration). "Kitty's Back" includes a snippet of "Bright Lights, Big City".

Precise setlist details remain problematic due to conflicting recollections. Critic Jon Landau's much-quoted "I saw rock and roll future and its name is Bruce Springsteen" line emanates from this night. Landau only attended, and his Real Paper review only covers, the late show. However Landau’s review, in conjunction with information from other attendee recollections, provides an accurate, albeit partial, setlist for the late show, one that lasted 20-30 minutes longer than the early show. Bruce opened with the slow arrangement of "The E Street Shuffle", the only known instance that Bruce has opened with this song. "For You" is the solo piano version. Bruce knew that Landau was attending the late show and he unveiled at least one new composition (possibly up to three) for Landau's ears. One of these, "Born To Run" (identified in Landau's review as the song with the “Telstar” guitar opening), is confirmed via multiple recollections, including later comments by Landau to Dave Marsh. If one or two additional “new songs” were performed during the late show (and this is where there are conflicting stories) then these would have been either "Angel's Blues" (previously only played on March 10) or “The Fever” (rarely played and considered new) or two songs that Bruce had written and was already fiddling with in the studio, "Jungleland" and "A Love So Fine".

An eight-song, 70-minute, continuous segment of the early show (plus two soundcheck tracks) can be found on 'Rock And Roll Punk' (E St) or 'Feel The Spirit', and 'I Sold My Heart To The Junkman' (Anubis Records). This is the entire early show according to the taper who has recently made the original tape transfer available. The MC’s use of the name “The E Street Band” in his introduction is the earliest appearance of that name on any show audio or promotional material yet unearthed. The E Street Band name was conjured up only a few weeks earlier. The first show’s audio is a quality audience recording made by a taper who had good equipment and an ideal recording spot. Indeed, a close analysis of background conversation during the soundcheck yields an argument between someone in Springsteen's camp and the taper over this person’s right to be recording the show. This person obviously got away with it during the first show but appears not to have been so fortunate for the second. A recording of the early show was included in the Springsteen exhibit 'From Asbury Park to the Promised Land' at Cleveland's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum. It was streamed to a listening station, where two people could listen simultaneously through headphones. The recording was made by musician/retired music teacher Michael Atherton, who carried a professional-model cassette recorder with an external microphone into the theatre and taped the show from a seat in the back. Apparently the taper made a few copies for friends, and it's likely that it was these tapes (or copies of them) that were eventually bootlegged. There is no known audio of the second (late) show.

1974-05-11 - FAIRLEIGH DICKINSON UNIVERSITY, RUTHERFORD, NJ

BORN TO RUN

No other details known. There has been some confusion about whether this show took place or was cancelled, but we are now certain this gig did go ahead. The show was held outdoors on the steps of the student union building, although recollections differ, since some remember the concert was indoors, in the school gymnasium. It was a cold evening, and one attendee recalls that Bruce wore a scarf around his neck. The gig is noted as having been played on Mike Appel's official accounting documentation and there is known fan recollections of it having taken place, yet the University's Library has reported to Brucebase that they have no record of it. One recollection states that "Song For Orphans" was played; if accurate, this would be unexpected, given that the last known performance was about seventeen months ago in January 1973. Another fan present recalls that "Born To Run" was included in the set.

The event was restructured and went ahead without Springsteen, with Fairport Convention headlining and local group The Bogus Baby Band opening.

NEW YORK CITY SERENADE / FOR YOU

One show, double bill, with Springsteen & The E Street Band headlining and slide guitar virtuoso Ellen McIlwaine opening (a late replacement for Hall & Oates). A Brucebase reader who attended comments "the opening act was originally supposed to be Hall & Oates but as we were on our way to the show on the Jersey Turnpike we heard them guest DJ'ing on WMMR-FM in Philadelphia. The show was primarily Wild & Innocent stuff. Bruce ended with a bunch of rock classics and them came back to do a solo "For You" on piano".

1974-05-25 - ARCHBISHOP JOHN CARROLL HIGH SCHOOL, RADNOR, PA

Cancelled Springsteen concert, never rescheduled. At the time (1974) there were separate boys and girls schools located on the same property. The concert had been planned for the school’s 500-seat theater, which was used by both schools. However the student entertainment committee in charge of organizing the event was unable to sell enough tickets to pay the required deposit so the gig was cancelled. WMMR-FM's Kevin Gunn recalled in 1998: "First of all, it's probably one of the more dubious distinctions of my old high school, but it's a true story. But in 1974 there was a woman named Maura Mccanney. She was a girl then, but she was the first kid on the block really to be totally into Bruce Springsteen at my high School; she turned me onto Bruce. She approached the management of Bruce when he was touring around the area and doing the colleges and everything and said, 'Hey, would he– would he come to Archbishop Carroll to do a show?' They said, "Sure, if you can sell x amount of tickets" – I think was 400, I can't be sure. Anyway, we tried and we tried and we could not meet the number, we could not get 400 tickets sold. And the reason was simple. That was Memorial Day weekend of 1974. And all the kids at Archbishop Carroll felt like going down the shore and doing the exact things that Bruce Springsteen was singing about. You know, chasing factory girls underneath the boardwalk and all that. So, the sad tale is that even though it isn't in Dave Marsh's Born To Run book as a date that happened, May 24th, I think, 1974, it was supposed Bruce at Archbishop Carroll – did not happen because we couldn't sell the 400 tickets. A great high school that I love dearly, but sadly one of the not the greatest moments in their history."

1974-06-01 - MEMORIAL GYMNASIUM, KENT STATE UNIVERSITY, KENT, OH

NEW YORK CITY SERENADE / NO MONEY DOWN / KITTY'S BACK / LET THE FOUR WINDS BLOW - I'M READY

One show, a six-hour quadruple billing extravaganza, with Springsteen & The E Street Band headlining. Support acts were Michael Stanley, The Banky Brothers Band and 15-60-75 (aka The Numbers Band). Held in the 5,000 seat Memorial Gymnasium. The show was well-attended, but was not a sellout. The second-billed Michael Stanley (and his band) opened the festivities with a 90-minute performance, followed by the two local bands, each of which played 60-minute sets - culminating in Springsteen & The E Street Band taking the stage at 10:30pm and playing for two hours. According to the contract documentation, the ticket price was $2.00. The above-mentioned partial setlist is from an attendee recollection.

There is no circulating audio from this show.

1974-06-02 - THE TOLEDO AGORA, TOLEDO, OH

A NIGHT LIKE THIS (7:45) / DOES THIS BUS STOP AT 82ND STREET? (4:05) / IT’S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY (4:29) / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT (cut, 0:07) / FOR YOU (8:16) / LET THE FOUR WINDS BLOW - I'M READY (start cut, 9:56)

One show, with Springsteen & The E Street Band headlining. Beginning shows with one or two acoustic numbers had been a pretty consistent hallmark of Springsteen's concerts up to this point. However this was one of the last shows of this type, as the hiring of Marc Brickman as stage lighting director in July 1974 pretty much ended the opening acoustic solo spots.

From an historical standpoint the important performance is the wonderful love song "A Night Like This" (often referred to by collectors by the title "Dance On Little Angel" or Bruce’s original working title "Angel Baby"). Springsteen, identifying it as "a new song" but not mentioning the title to the crowd, performs it acoustically (with Clarence and Danny). Although "A Night Like This" bears no common melody or lyrics with "4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)", the two are stylistically similar and set along the summer Jersey shoreline. A studio take of this song has never surfaced but one was recorded a few months later (at 914 Sound Studios on October 16). Bruce later used a few tidbits of lyric from "A Night Like This" for his early 1975 composition "Lonely Night In The Park", a recording from the Born To Run sessions, which first circulated after being played during Sirius' E Street Radio's initial launch (November 1, 2005 to January 31, 2006), after which an MP3 has been widely circulated with the last few seconds cut and a running time of 4:32, per springsteenlyrics.com. "For You" is the solo piano version.

The above-mentioned partial setlist is taken from an audience recording of very weak quality that has been in limited circulation for many years. The material has yet to appear on any mainstream bootleg. The audio likely represents only about 30% of the evening’s total performance. All but a few opening seconds of "Spirit In The Night" is cut, as well as the opening minute or so of the evening finale, "Let The Four Winds Blow". Although this tape often circulates as undated, there are in fact several vital clues that almost certainly pinpoint the tape to this date and venue. Firstly, Bruce specifically mentions the name "The E Street Band" (which places the show no earlier than April 1974). Secondly, Bruce asks the audience how many of them have travelled from Detroit for this show (most respond yes, Toledo is only 70 kilometers from Detroit). Thirdly, this arrangement of "Let The Four Winds Blow - I'm Ready" was unique to the mid-1974 period and very similar to the following night's rendition in Cleveland. Fortunately the audio of the new song ("Angel Baby") is complete and the sound quality is somewhat better on this track than the rest of the audio.

1974-06-03 - THE AGORA, CLEVELAND, OH

SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT (6.04) / THE E STREET SHUFFLE - HAVING A PARTY (8.13) / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) (6.43) / YOU NEVER CAN TELL (8.40) / TOKYO (edit, 5.22) / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) (9.54) / LET THE FOUR WINDS BLOW - I'M READY (11.04)

One show, double bill, with Springsteen & The E Street Band headlining and Orphan opening.

Most (possibly all) of this 100-minute show was recorded by WMMS-FM in Cleveland, then edited to fit into a 60-minute time schedule and broadcast for the first time on June 5 at 10.00pm -11.00pm. There were approximately 40 minutes (four to six songs) of the performance not broadcast and none of the unbroadcast material is in circulation, if indeed it ever survived the editing room. The above-mentioned setlist represents only those songs that were broadcast and can be found in excellent soundboard quality on the CD 'You Never Can Tell' (Piggham), as well as titles such as 'And The Band Played' (Swingin' Pig) plus 'And The E Street Band Played' (Scorpio). "Tokyo" is also found on the 'All Those Years' compilation. The 60-minute recording is also available in a transfer from the WMMS Cleveland reel-to-reel masters. The sound quality of this transfer is exceptional. View the info. The master recording is also on CD 'When The Four Winds Blow' (Godfather). Released to retail in the UK in 2015 with the title 'The Cleveland Shuffle 1974' (Refractor Records). WMMS-FM editors selected a good cross-section of the entire show. Highlights include a striking rendition of Chuck Berry's "You Never Can Tell" and the last known (and probably tightest) live performance of "Tokyo", which by mid-'74 seems to be morphing into a new title with altered lyrics sometimes called "Sleepytown". The audio from this show is often incorrectly linked to the Agora show of February 18, however this earlier show was cancelled and never happened.

1974-06-13 - CIVIC CENTER MUSIC HALL, OKLAHOMA CITY, OK

Cancelled show, never rescheduled. Springsteen & The E Street Band had been booked as the show opener for headliner The Guess Who, at the time one of the biggest selling rock acts in North America. Apparently the sudden resignation of two of the members of The Guess Who (Kurt Winter and Donnie McDougall) was the reason for the cancellation.

Cancelled Springsteen performance, although the concert went ahead anyway. Originally slated as one show, double bill, with Springsteen opening for headliner Maria Muldaur, who was riding high in the charts at the time with “Midnight At The Oasis”. The show went ahead anyway, with Danny O'Keefe substituted for Springsteen. Apparently the concert tickets exhibit Springsteen’s, not O'Keefe’s, name as the undercard so he must’ve pulled out fairly late in the process.

1974-06-21 - LE GARAGE, SPRAY BEACH, NJ

NEW YORK CITY SERENADE

No other set details known. Two shows, double bill, with Springsteen & The E Street Band headlining at the opening night of this now-defunct teen club (strictly no liquor!) located at 23rd St. & Bay Blvd in Spray Beach on Long Beach Island. The club was housed in a former garage for trucks and heavy equipment, owned by the Laputka family. It was remodeled and originally run as a night club for teenagers around 1967-72 and featured UV lights that made white clothing glow in the dark. Financed by impresario Gary Goodell, it was opened as a concert hall in the spring of 1974.

Walt Beadling helped set up and run the club, and he sent this to Brucebase: "We opened with Springsteen on Friday, June 21, 1974. I'd never heard of the guy before. He started with "New York City Serenade". I'll never forget it. The whole place was dark. Bruce stood center stage, illuminated in a single spotlight, and started singing a cappella. One by one, the other members of the band starting, with David Sancious on piano, joined in. I was mesmerized; he completely blew us all away. What a showman. Who is this guy? We packed the house Friday and Saturday. He offered to do another show on Sunday to help us dig out of the financial mess we were in. We had an impromptu keg party with Bruce and the band at somebody's beach house that weekend. Bruce was a skinny little guy with a beard from somewhere up North - despite his charisma and the great shows he put on for us, I didn't think much of it at the time. Little did I know . . ."

"We lost money that weekend despite Bruce's generosity, which should have been our first clue that our business model was seriously flawed. We couldn't afford acts that would fill the place, but still had to pay the ones who didn't. Gary was deep in the hole by the end of July; various shady looking characters and local merchants kept coming around looking for the money we owed them. Somehow we survived. I tried to help keep the doors open by running classic old films on nights when we didn't have live entertainment - the Marx Brothers and Rebel without a Cause are a some of the ones I remember. Eventually reality set in and Gary had to close the doors of Le Garage for good. Sometime later the Laputka's sold Le Garage to a developer who tore it down and put up condos where our special, unforgettable summer place once stood."

Previous information had Bruce and the band performing only a single show, but an article in the Beachcomber newspaper indicates that there were two shows tonight, confirmed by those present. Country/rock house band Slim Pickins opened for Springsteen, not the local glam-rock house band as previously thought. The three-night (five-show) residency at Le Garage was a last-minute addition to the tour itinerary and took place amidst recording sessions at 914 Sound Studios. Springsteen would return to Le Garage for four shows over two nights in July, another late addition to the tour schedule.

1974-06-22 - LE GARAGE, SPRAY BEACH, NJ

No setlist details known. Two shows, double bill, with Springsteen & The E Street Band headlining at this club out on Long Beach Island. The bill was the same as the previous night with country/rock house band Slim Pickins opening for Springsteen. A Brucebase reader comments: "the venue was right next to the beach and I spoke to Bruce in between the opening band and his show, while listening to the ocean waves. You paid at the door and got a folding chair to sit on. The place is now a clothing store I think". Actually the club was across the street from the Spray Beach Yacht Club next to a car wash. The site is currently occupied by radio towers and dishes. Another Brucebase reader adds: "Someone asked for 'Rosalita' and Bruce said 'I don't know if I remember that one'... then launched right into it! I also remember the folding chairs".

Springsteen pulled out well in advance, before tickets were sold or any promotion mentioning Springsteen was undertaken. The two shows went ahead anyway, with Tom Waits substituting for Bruce.

1974-07-12 - BOTTOM LINE, NEW YORK CITY, NY

JUNGLELAND (11.28) / KITTY'S BACK (16.00)

No other set details known. Two shows, 8:30pm and 11:30pm, double billing, with singer-songwriter Jeffrey Comanor opening for Springsteen & The E Street Band, as noted on pre-concert advertising material. Comanor performed a short opening set. Recollections differ, but he may not have appeared at all six shows of the three-day stand. First night of a three-night (six-show) residency at the newly- opened club. Neither show on opening night was a sellout, although word spread quickly and the following two nights were packed.

In an interview, long-time Bottom Line owner Allan Pepper stated that he has attempted to release two tracks ("Jungleland" and "Kitty's Back") from the opening night as part of a four-CD compilation box-set comprised of performances at the club by an assortment of artists. While he received permission to issue the tracks from Springsteen and Jon Landau, unfortunately Columbia did not give their approval. Part of the concert (either the early or late show) was recorded as a test-taping for a scheduled radio broadcast the following night by New York University's radio station. For reasons unknown, Mike Appel halted the test recording mid-show and cancelled the radio broadcast, despite the station having approval from Springsteen's record company. It's possible that the two fine quality rogue soundboard recordings of "Jungleland" and "Kitty's Back" that circulate are the two tracks that Pepper intended to release.

Brucebase reader Chris Prondzinski writes about a friend who had connections with the Springsteen camp at the time: "He got a job at the Bottom Line when it opened, and Bruce was one of the first to perform there. Because of his employment and the very loose rules on security, he could get his hands on a recording of the show very easily. He said that he remembered on the first night of the Springsteen stand in the summer of 1974 barely anyone was there. So he didn’t do much that night and he got an opportunity to watch the show. Afterwards, he talked to the club owner Allan and said “that was a great show, this guy should get booked here often. I really like his music.” Allan responded with “Yes. If you like the show so much, I have two songs from the show that we got off the soundboard.” He followed Allan into a back room with shelves and a brand new reel to reel tape was in a box on the shelf, labeled with the date. Now apparently Allan had a reel to reel tape recorder and player at the club, but the two machines were not able to make copies. So my buddy said he could make a copy at his apartment and bring it back in a few days. And so he lent him the master recording and he got a direct transfer from the original. He made two copies to two cassettes. He listened to the two songs until the tape was broken. The other one sat in a box for years, forgotten about. It finally saw the light of day recently and this story came with it."

Based on all the information we have, it seems highly likely that the two tracks are from one of tonight's shows, and are related to the radio test taping. "Jungleland" (with work-in-progress lyrics/arrangement) can be found on the CD set 'All Those Years' (Templar). A 7:43 edited version with a premature fade-out also circulates. "Kitty's Back", complete with a 60-second intro by Bruce explaining about how he pinched the song's title from a striptease club sign, can be found on the CD 'Bound For Glory' (Flamingo). Both songs are also bonus tracks on the CD 'The Roxy Theatre Night' (Crystal Cat). If the recording of "Jungleland" does emanate from this show, it would be the earliest circulating live rendition. The arrangement is distinctly different from the final version, with the closing solo instead played by Springsteen after the second verse, an extended jazzy instrumental in the middle section and lyrical variations throughout.

Two shows, 8:30pm and 11:30pm, with Springsteen & The E Street Band headlining. As noted on the pre-concert advertising material, singer-songwriter Jeffrey Comanor opened for Springsteen, performing a short set. Recollections differ however, and he may not have appeared at all six shows of the three-day stand. According to Bottom Line owner Allan Pepper, one of tonight's shows was scheduled to be broadcast by New York University's radio station. However, for reasons unknown, Mike Appel cancelled the broadcast.

Audience tape. The above-listed 12-song setlist is believed to encompass a complete performance and is taken from an audience recording of reasonable quality. This audio can be found in its entirety on the CD ‘No Money Down’ (Winged Wheel) and is likely to be from the second show, although this hasn't been verified. This audience tape also circulates as 'Watch The World Explode' (Kivak Master Series). This is a transfer from the master cassettes. This show includes what are currently the earliest circulating live renditions of opener "Then She Kissed Me", "Born To Run" (note the work-in-progress lyrics) and Chuck Berry's "No Money Down".

1974-07-14 - BOTTOM LINE, NEW YORK CITY, NY

Two shows, 8:30pm and 11:30pm, with Springsteen & The E Street Band the sole act on the bill. As noted on pre-concert advertisements, singer-songwriter Jeffrey Comanor opened for Springsteen, performing a short set. Recollections differ however, and he may not have appeared at all six shows of the three-day stand.

The black and white footage of "Jungleland" that can be seen on the making-of-Born To Run documentary Wings For Wheels is likely to derive from one of the shows in this stand. With Ernest 'Boom' Carter on the drums it must pre-date August 14, and the early arrangement of "Jungleland" would place the footage around this date. The audio does not match any performance of "Jungleland" known to circulate and photographs of Springsteen taken during the Bottom Line stand are very similar to what can be seen on the video. The footage is likely to have been shot by Barry Rebo.

1974-07-19 - OZARK MUSIC FESTIVAL, SEDALIA, MO

Cancelled Springsteen performance, although the event took place as planned. This three-day, 19-act 'Woodstock-style' festival held at the Missouri State Fairgrounds ended up attracting over 350,000, one of the largest music concert crowds in history. Springsteen was billed very low in the pecking order (see poster above) and was scheduled to play early on the opening day. The reason Springsteen didn’t play is the subject of some dispute, with some claims having Bruce’s tour bus breaking down en route to Missouri, resulting in them showing up late and being told by the promoter that they couldn’t be re-slotted into the schedule. However others claim there was no tour bus incident and Bruce was never anywhere near Missouri, rather, Mike Appel withdrew Springsteen’s services from Ozark after the west coast tour leg that began on July 25 was stitched together.

SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / DOES THIS BUS STOP AT 82ND STREET? / THE E STREET SHUFFLE / JUNGLELAND / KITTY'S BACK / NEW YORK CITY SERENADE / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT)

One show, double billing, with Springsteen & The E Street Band opening for headliner Dr John. As the support act Bruce's performance lasted only about 70 minutes (although a Robert Hilburn article says the performance was only 45 minutes). Attendance at this show was disappointing, however Phonograph Record Magazine's Michael Davis gave Bruce a glowing review, commenting: "from the third song on each number was followed by a standing ovation (the venue) didn't sound half empty during Springsteen's set, that's for sure". The above-mentioned, seven-song setlist is from an attendee recollection and represents most (if not all) of the performance at this show.

No set details known. Two shows, double bill, with Springsteen & The E Street Band headlining and Danny O'Keefe opening. Although Bruce was struggling for recognition in western states he had a sizeable following in Phoenix. This was originally scheduled as one show but ticket demand was strong a second (late) show was added, both shows were sellouts. It seems Mike Appel was able to negotiate a percentage of the gate with promoter Doug Clark for the second show that resulted in a combined show payday of $11,500 for Bruce and the boys, nearly triple their previous best.

INCIDENT ON 57TH STREET / JUNGLELAND

One show, double bill, with Springsteen & The E Street Band headlining and Tim Weisberg & John Hammond Jr. (performing as a duo) opening. A rare 'daytime and indoor' concert, often incorrectly listed as having been played outdoors at the Tuscon Motor Speedway. The above-mentioned partial setlist details are from an attendee recollection. This was a full, 90-minute Springsteen performance.

1974-07-30 - THE TROUBADOUR, WEST HOLLYWOOD, CA

No full set details known. One (informal) show, triple billing, with Springsteen & The E Street Band co-headlining with Roger McGuinn, former leader of The Byrds. The opening act was Hawaiian folk duo Cecilio & Kapono. This event was billed as 'Columbia Guest Artists Week', with 'mystery'" artists from the CBS roster appearing each night. This six-day event bore some conceptual similarities to CBS's Ahmanson Theatre week-long promotion the previous year (see May 1, 1973 listing). As it turned out Bruce and McGuinn were the selected performers for the first night, with specifics leaking out only 72 hours or so beforehand, as well as wildfire rumors that Bob Dylan might play as well, ensuring tickets for the opening night were at a premium and in the hands of the LA media elite. Dylan was a false rumour but this gig would be a huge publicity breakthrough for Springsteen, who up to this point was having serious problems breaking through on the west coast. Cecilio & Kapono opened at 9.00pm, Roger McGuinn (and his band) followed at 11:30pm and Springsteen & The E Street Band took the stage around 2.00am and closed the evening with a rousing 90-minute (or 120-minute, recollections vary) performance. The above-mentioned partial setlist details are from an attendee recollection combined with a brief description of the show in the LA Times and a review by Harold Bronson in Cash Box magazine.

1974-08-03 - SCHAEFER MUSIC FESTIVAL, CENTRAL PARK, NEW YORK CITY, NY

JUNGLELAND / KITTY'S BACK / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT)

No full set details known. One show, triple bill, with Springsteen & The E Street Band occupying the middle slot in a show headlined by Anne Murray, with Brewer & Shipley as the opening act.

This is an evening show held outdoors in the Wollman Ice Rink Theatre within Central Park, taking place while Springsteen is in town recording at 914 Studios in Blauvelt. This concert had originally been booked with Boz Scaggs headlining, Anne Murray billed second and Brewer & Shipley opening. When headliner Scaggs pulled out of the gig in June promoter Ron Delsener replaced him with Springsteen in the headlining slot. However Shep Gordon and Johnny Podell (managers of Murray) objected to Springsteen receiving headlining status, citing Murray's superior commercial success. As a consequence the schedule was changed the week before the show, with Murray receiving the top billing. Advertisements exist from both before and after the change of headlining status (see photos above). Mike Appel reluctantly agreed with the change on the condition that Springsteen would be allowed to perform for at least 80 minutes. As it turned out approximately 80% of the 5,000-strong crowd came specifically to see Springsteen, and half way through Bruce's performance Murray's managers realized they'd made a serious mistake, even trying in vain to get Mike Appel to yank Bruce offstage prematurely. Needless to say Bruce played his full show and Anne Murray was placed in the nightmarish position of having to follow him! A review in Village Voice (click the above link to read the review) states that a quarter of the crowd left after Springsteen's set, and only a quarter of those remaining were left by the time Murray had finished hers. The partial setlist above is from an attendee recollection. This would turn out to be the last time (except for charity benefits) that Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band opened for another artist.

A Brucebase reader who attended the show states "It is absolutely true that most of the crowd booed when the announcer informed us that Anne Murray would be out in fifteen minutes, while we were still screaming for another encore. Most of us left. In Los Angeles, Marc Brickman (Bruce's lighting director) was talking to my wife and said that Anne Murray was hysterical backstage, really pissed off that her manager had forced Bruce to play second. The story made it to John Sebastian, who voluntarily took second spot (in a triple-billing) on October 18 in Passaic." Another fan present also remembers that the vast majority left after Springsteen, leaving only around a quarter of the original audience for Murray.

1974-08-13 - THE STONE BALLOON, NEWARK, DE

SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / JUNGLELAND

One show, double bill, with Springsteen & The E Street Band headlining and NJ-based outfit Mother, Flag And Country opening. The Stone Balloon was a new 900-seat club catering for students at the University Of Delaware. This was a make-up date for a scheduled July appearance that had been postponed due to studio commitments. Despite the show being a sell-out, a large crowd turned up hoping in vain to obtain standing room tickets, these people hung around all evening in street party mode, causing some nervousness among nearby residents. The Stone Balloon’s then owner-manager Bill Stevenson has commented: “when Newark’s Police Chief paid a visit around 2.00am he asked ”when is this guy supposed to stop?” Complete setlist details are not known but the two above-mentioned tracks are noted in a review of the show. It seems unlikely that “Born To Run” was performed. Over the years much folklore seems to have also developed surrounding the length of this show. There were technical difficulties that caused over a two hour delay between the finish of Mother God & Country’s set and the start of the Springsteen set, resulting in Bruce & The E Street Band not taking the stage until after midnight. Bruce made up for the hassles with a magnificent two-hour show, but not the four to five hour performance of urban legend!

Two shows, double billing, with Springsteen & The E Street Band headlining and The Incredible String Band opening at the newly renamed Monmouth Arts Center - previously the Carlton Theater. The above-mentioned partial setlist details are culled from a review of the gig in the Asbury Park Evening Press and attendee recollections. No additional song titles are mentioned in the review, although it is stated that “new material” was performed (“Jungleland” and “She’s The One” being likely inclusions, but there may have been others). A review of the late show in the Red Bank Register mentions a solo piano opener, confirmed by an attendee to be "New York City Serenade", and also recalls "4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy). "Born To Run" was also played, with Bruce acting like a conductor, directing Boom Carter during the instrumental break. The house lights didn't come on until 4am - problems with the sound meant that Bruce didn't get going until 12:30 on the morning of the August 15. These were the final performances of Ernest 'Boom' Carter and David Sancious as E Street Band members. Sancious has commented that they’d made their intentions to depart known to Bruce several weeks prior to this night, although the rest of the band only found out a couple of days beforehand, seemingly because Bruce had hoped the two might change their minds.

There is no known audio from this night in circulation.

1974-08-23 - 914 SOUND REHEARSAL ROOM, BLAUVELT, NY

Following the placement of 'help wanted' ads in the NY Village Voice in early August and a series of tryout sessions held at 914 Sound Studios during the week of August 18 to 23, pianist Roy Bittan and drummer Max Weinberg are selected as the two new members of The E Street Band. Roy was required to attend two tryout sessions but was actually chosen a couple of days before Max, who attended only one tryout session. Weinberg has stated that his drumming during a workout of “Let The Four Winds Blow” was what sealed Bruce’s decision to pick him. With the new line-up settled the group spend about ten hours per day for the next two weeks in rehearsal.

1974-08-24 - CINEAMATIC CIRCUS, WOODBOURNE, NY

Cancelled show, presumably due to rehearsal or recording session commitments. One show, with Springsteen the only artist on the bill. Advertised in the local press only in late July 1974, so one assumes the show was cancelled soon after. We can find little information about Cineamatic Circus, but it was situated on the intersection of Routes 42 and 52 in the hamlet of Woodbourne, NY and hosted a variety of movies and live performances. Other artists advertised include Commander Cody and his Lost Planet Airmen, Lenny Schultz and the Climax Blues Band. There is no press before June 1974 and after August 1974, so it seems the venue was very short-lived.

1974-09-08 - THE STONE PONY, ASBURY PARK, NJ

No set details known. Unannounced and unadvertised Springsteen makes his first known stage appearance at this now-legendary club (it had opened in February 1974), as a guest of The Blackberry Booze Band (headed by Steve Van Zandt and Southside Johnny). Garry Tallent and former E Street drummer Vini Lopez are also in attendance and join Bruce on stage for a lengthy late night jam. A couple of months after this show The Blackberry Booze Band would morph into Southside Johnny & The Asbury Jukes.

1974-09-19 - THE MAIN POINT, BRYN MAWR, PA

Early (first) show: THE E STREET SHUFFLE / LOST IN THE FLOOD / GIMME THAT WINE / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) / A LOVE SO FINE (A NIGHT LIKE THIS)

Also performed: CUPID / LET THE FOUR WINDS BLOW (see below)

Two ‘dress-rehearsal’ shows, delayed to 9:30pm and 12:20am, with a 'new look' Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band the sole act on the bill. These shows were late additions to the itinerary, unadvertised except by word-of-mouth, and only finalized after the following night’s show at the nearby Tower Theatre had sold out. The shows were originally scheduled at 8.00pm and 10:30pm but were pushed back due to a lengthy soundcheck and then a two-hour first show, followed by a two-hour second show (which due to its starting time is sometimes listed as September 20). This was the public performance debut as E Street Band members for Max Weinberg and Roy Bittan. Violinist Suki Lahav would begin appearances with the band on October 4, however Suki (then-wife of 914 Sound Studios engineer Louis Lahav) was always considered a 'guest' performer, never an official member of the E Street Band like Roy and Max were.

Partial early show setlist above is from a review in The Villanovan, student newspaper of Villanova University. The reviewer makes several notable comments, including that Springsteen (introduced as "the greatest performer I have ever seen") opens with a song from his upcoming album. This is possibly "Born To Run", but it's more likely to be a song that the author doesn't recognise. When played, "Born To Run" usually takes a mid-set position in the setlist. Secondly, the reviewer notes that a jazz-laden "A Night Like This" is performed, only played once before in an acoustic format on June 2 in Toledo, OH. "A Night Like This" is recorded in the studio in October during the Born To Run sessions but doesn't make the album and is not known to have been performed again. However, since audio from three days later at Kean College has recently emerged which includes "A Love So Fine" sung with the chorus 'a night like this', we can perhaps assume that this song is actually "A Love So Fine", and was part of the encore. The main set closes with "4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy). Stuart Green, then house manager of the Tower Theater in Upper Darby, attended one of these two Main Point shows and commented to Brucebase that Springsteen performed “Cupid” and “Let The Four Winds Blow” as encores. It is likely that this is the premiere of the cover of Sam Cooke’s “Cupid”.

No known audio.

1974-09-20 - TOWER THEATER, UPPER DARBY, PHILADELPHIA, PA

INCIDENT ON 57TH STREET / THEN SHE KISSED ME / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / NEW YORK CITY SERENADE / LOST IN THE FLOOD / THE E STREET SHUFFLE / JUNGLELAND / KITTY'S BACK / FOR YOU / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY)

One show, 9.00pm, with Bruce & The E Street Band the sole act on the bill. Show was a sellout. Springsteen was originally scheduled to play at 7:30pm because there was a separate admission midnight show (not featuring Springsteen) headlined by ex-Move guitarist Roy Wood. However Wood cancelled his show just hours beforehand and the Springsteen show was then moved to later in the evening. Near-complete setlist details (missing only a couple of song titles) are known for this show thanks to several post-concert reviews that appeared in local area papers. "For You" is the solo piano version. Springsteen returned to stage for a final encore following “4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)” and performed what one of the reviewers describes as “a Motown number”, but its title is not noted. It could well be "A Love So Fine", a song which regularly formed part of the encores at this time.

No known audio.

1974-09-21 - HUNT UNION BALLROOM, STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK, ONEONTA, NY

No set details known. One show, held in the Hunt Union Ballroom, with Springsteen & The E Street Band headlining and folk stylist Jae Mason opening. Originally scheduled to be held in the 3,000 capacity P.E. Building, the gig was moved to the smaller, 1,200 seat ballroom some time after the gig was advertised in the campus newspaper, the State Times. Despite the move the gig was still not fully sold-out, with only around 900 souls in attendance. The State Times had a picture of Springsteen in its next edition, but no review or comments of any kind about the concert.

1974-09-22 - KEAN COLLEGE, UNION, NJ

SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / DOES THIS BUS STOP AT 82ND STREET? / THE E STREET SHUFFLE - HAVING A PARTY / FOR YOU / IT'S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY / CUPID / KITTY'S BACK / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / A LOVE SO FINE - SHOUT

One free outdoor show, double bill, with Springsteen & Band headlining and folk stylist Jae Mason opening, held outdoors on the lawn behind the student center. The set features the earliest confirmed and recorded "A Love So Fine", however the song is still clearly in the early stages of development since the chorus is sung "a night like this", rather than "a love so fine." It's worth noting that by the time the next show came around at Avery Fisher Hall, Bruce had changed the chorus to the familiar "a love so fine." "A Night Like This" is a different song (otherwise unrelated to "A Love So Fine") that was recorded for Born To Run in October, and was performed in an acoustic format in Toledo, OH in June 1974. Unusually for the tour, "For You" is performed in the full-band arrangement.

This was Bruce's first engagement here since the Dr Zoom gig (see May 15, 1971 listing) back when the school was known as Newark State College. Check out some photos of the show by clicking the above link. After the show Springsteen is interviewed by Alan Edwards for a Trenton Times Sunday magazine cover story that ran in October 1974. Alan currently works for Appleseed Recordings, an independent music label that has featured Springsteen's music on several releases, including the 1997 Pete Seeger tribute Where Have All the Flowers Gone: The Songs of Pete Seeger.

The above setlist is from a decent audience recording which first circulated in November 2012 (JEMS). However, it may not represent the entire show with two or three songs potentially missing. The tape is notable as the earliest known recording of the E Street Band with new members Max Weinberg and Roy Bittan, introduced as "Mighty Max" and "Mr. Roy Bittan" during "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" .

1974-10-04 - AVERY FISHER HALL, LINCOLN CENTER, NEW YORK CITY, NY

INCIDENT ON 57TH STREET (7.59) / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT (5.56) / DOES THIS BUS STOP AT 82ND STREET? (4.08) / THE E STREET SHUFFLE - HAVING A PARTY (10.47) / CUPID (4.04) / IT'S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY (3.58) / LOST IN THE FLOOD (7.46) / SHE'S THE ONE (6.50) / JUNGLELAND (9.55) / A LOVE SO FINE - SHOUT (6.50) / KITTY'S BACK (14.38) / NEW YORK CITY SERENADE (15.23) / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) (9.54) / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) (6.11) / QUARTER TO THREE (6.37)

One show, with Springsteen & The E Street Band the sole artist on the bill. First confirmed performance of "She's The One", an early version containing some lyrics that would end up in "Backstreets". This is the E Street Band debut of violinist Suki Lahav, who has stated that her performance this night was originally intended to be a one-off except that it was so well received by the audience that Bruce asked her to continue. Suki didn't perform at the following two gigs at Albright and Clark but thereafter was a fixture in every show until the end of the tour. "Lost In The Flood" features an extended piano and clarinet introduction that is highly reminiscent of the instrumental later found between late 1975 and March 1977 at the beginning of "It's My Life". "A Love So Fine" includes a snippet of "Shout". Chaos reigned near the end of this show and a Brucebase reader who attended explains why: "My wife and I were in front of the stage during "Quarter To Three" when the first two rows of seats next to us just disappeared, the left side of the stage and first couple of rows fell about six feet. A couple of monitors fell in where the people were seated but it didn't appear that anyone got hurt. The encore was abruptly ended however".

For this concert we are fortunate to have two unique items; handwritten setlists penned not by Bruce, but by Clarence Clemons and Danny Federici. Prior to every show Bruce would compose his setlist in the green room, just as he does today. Rather than make copies, the band would then copy his setlist in order to have it in their own handwriting. Usually these setlist copies would be made on a small memo pad and disappear by the end of the show, however Avery Fisher Hall had their own music stands, and so the setlists were written on larger sheets of paper. These two pages were picked up in the green room after the show by Art Reilly, a member of Springsteen's lighting crew. Several interesting nuggets of information can be gleaned from these setlists. First of all, Springsteen seemed to be just as likely to keep to his list in 1974 as he does today: "The E Street Shuffle" was listed after "It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City" and "Born To Run" was dropped from it's slot after "She's The One". According to the setlist, "Night" follows "Jungleland". Written in shorthand, this is actually "A Night Like This", the alternative title for "A Love So Fine" at this point in time. See the above listings from Kean College and The Main Point for more detail. The most notable song however is the listed closer, The Drifters' "On Broadway", which Springsteen intended to play after "Quarter To Three" - hardly surprising given Avery Fisher Hall's close proximity to Broadway. Unfortunately the front section of the stage collapsed before he got a chance. We have no record of Springsteen ever playing "On Broadway".

The above-mentioned setlist represents the complete 15-song show. A mediocre quality audience recording of the entire show circulates and can be found in its entirety on CDRs 'Cupid's A Fine One At Quarter To 3' or 'Cupid In The City'. Also available from Joe Kivak's master cassettes as 'Incident At Avery Fisher Hall' in much improved quality, as well as CDR 'I Saw Rock And Roll Future' on the Midnight Dreamer label.

1974-10-05 - BOLLMAN CENTER, ALBRIGHT COLLEGE, READING, PA

INCIDENT ON 57TH STREET / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / TWISTIN' THE NIGHT AWAY / IT'S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY / LOST IN THE FLOOD / FOR YOU / KITTY'S BACK / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT)

One show, held in the sold-out 2,000-seat Bollman Center. Springsteen & The E Street Band headline. Folk stylist Jae Mason (and his band) opened with 45-minute set. Although violinist Suki Lahav had made her debut the previous night, she is not present at this show or the following night at Clark University. The eight above-mentioned songs represent a partial setlist from the show and are mentioned in an extensive review that appeared in the school newspaper and a review in The Gettysburgian, student newspaper of Gettysburg College. Springsteen's set lasted for 2½ hrs (no intermission) and Bruce actually comments to the student reporter after the show that this was one of his longest shows to date. The reporter states that following the show the band (including Springsteen) were laid spread out on the stage in a state of total exhaustion. During "Kitty's Back" Bruce broke his guitar string and repaired it onstage, facilitating an exceptionally long rendition of the song. At one point Bruce was even running around in the audience. Of major historical interest is Bruce's rendition of Sam Cooke's "Twistin' The Night Away", the only verified performance by The E Street Band.

There is no known audio from this show.

1974-10-06 - ATWOOD HALL, CLARK UNIVERSITY, WORCESTER, MA

INCIDENT ON 57TH STREET / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / SHE'S THE ONE / JUNGLELAND / KITTY'S BACK / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / A LOVE SO FINE

One show, held in the jam packed, 900-seat Atwood Hall. Bruce & The E Street Band is the sole act on the bill. Partial (but sequential as they appeared) setlist details above culled from Clark's Student Newspaper. According to the young student critic who reviewed the show the consensus around campus was that this was the best concert ever held at the school. The opening 'spotlight solo' during "Incident On 57th Street" was taken by Roy Bittan, not Suki Lahav, it seems clear from the descriptive nature of the newspaper concert review that Suki did not perform at this concert.

1974-10-11 - SHADY GROVE MUSIC FAIR, GAITHERSBURG, MD

INCIDENT ON 57TH STREET / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / DOES THIS BUS STOP AT 82ND STREET? / THE E STREET SHUFFLE - HAVING A PARTY / IT'S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY / LOST IN THE FLOOD / SHE'S THE ONE / JUNGLELAND / KITTY'S BACK

One show, double bill, with Springsteen & The E Street Band headlining and comedian Martin Mull opening. Shady Grove Music Fair was a theatre-in-the-round with a rotating stage which was knocked down to make way for a shopping center not too long afterwards.

Partial setlist details above are from an audience recording, available on the CD 'Jungleland, MD' (KMA). These represent the first nine songs of the show. There are four or five songs from this show that are missing, apparently not taped by this recording source.

1974-10-12 - ALEXANDER HALL, PRINCETON UNIVERSITY, PRINCETON, NJ

INCIDENT ON 57TH STREET (8.09) / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT (cut, 6.41) / DOES THIS BUS STOP AT 82ND STREET? (3.59) / THE E STREET SHUFFLE - HAVING A PARTY (11.23) / IT'S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY (4.01) / LOST IN THE FLOOD (7.39) / SHE'S THE ONE (7.05) / JUNGLELAND (10.05) / KITTY'S BACK (cut, 5.35) / NEW YORK CITY SERENADE (15.34) / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) (9.18) / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) (5.56) / A LOVE SO FINE (cut at end, 8.00)

Two shows, 7:30pm and 10:30pm. A reader comments "This concert took place in Alexander Hall, not in McCarter Theater. The capacity of Alexander Hall was much larger than McCarter Theater. I believe McCarter was just the booking agent for this event. My freshman class orientation took place in Alexander Hall, so the capacity at that time had to be around 1,100 or more". Bruce and the band have sole billing. Both shows were sellouts and one of the shows circulates in its entirety on an average quality audience tape. Given that there's no discernible stop-start (see below) during "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" then the complete 13-song setlist mentioned above is the late show. There's a rare blunder by the band on "Spirit In The Night", which is stopped and started again. "A Love So Fine" includes a very brief instrumental snippet of "Shout". Another Brucebase reader comments: "I was 16 and wanted a Bruce T-shirt but there weren't any, so my friends and I made T-shirts from the Greetings album. During 'Rosalita' I jumped on stage and gave one to Bruce. I don't think he had ever seen one before and he stopped the song and looked at it before starting again. During the break between shows we went to the band's bus and gave shirts to everyone. They loved it and always looked out for us after that".

A recording of the other show has yet to surface. An audience tape of average quality is available on CDR 'Spanish Johnny and Puerto Rican Jane' (Kivak Master Series). This is a transfer from the master cassettes.

1974-10-18 - CAPITOL THEATRE, PASSAIC, NJ

INCIDENT ON 57TH STREET (9.14) / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT (6.41) / DOES THIS BUS STOP AT 82ND STREET? (4.18) / THE E STREET SHUFFLE - HAVING A PARTY (13.00) / IT'S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY (4.08) / SPANISH HARLEM (4.38) / SHE'S THE ONE (7.02) / JUNGLELAND (11.06) / KITTY'S BACK (17.15) / NEW YORK CITY SERENADE (18.53) / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) (11.12) / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) (7.01) / A LOVE SO FINE

One show, with Springsteen & The E Street Band closing the show (although billed second), headliner John Sebastian playing second and an up-and-coming Dan Fogelberg opening. Sebastian wisely let Bruce close, after hearing about the events of Anne Murray's predicament on August 3 and watching the band soundcheck. First known Springsteen version of "Spanish Harlem". "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection. "A Love So Fine" includes a brief instrumental snippet of "Shout". John Scher spoke about the concert in an interview with Jay Lustig for Backstreets: During soundcheck, says Scher, "I was just sitting in the empty theater, watching what was going on, and John Sebastian came over and sat down next to me. And we were just bullshitting. And then, ten minutes, 15 minutes into bullshitting, the E Street Band started playing. And in those days — it could still be in these days, I don't know — they took every second they were on the stage very seriously. They weren't just fucking around. They were playing. I can't remember how long they soundchecked for. Somewhere between a half hour and an hour, I would say.

"And when they were finished, Sebastian turned around to me and said, 'There is not a chance in the fucking world that I'm following this! Not a chance, John. There's nothing you can say that will get me to close the show.' And I said, 'Look, you're the headliner.' He said, 'I don't give a shit. I'm not following this!' And so, after I determined that he wasn't screwing around, and he was dead serious, I went backstage and talked to Bruce. And I said, 'Here's what Sebastian said. Will you close? Do you mind?' And of course he didn't mind. He was fine. And Sebastian was great. But Bruce followed him."

The setlist above represents Bruce's entire 13-song show and is available via an audience recording of good quality, if uneven in spots. Available on CDR transferred from Joe Kivak's master cassettes as 'Spanish Harlem 74' (Kivak Master Series), four songs contain some tape warp from the degraded master tapes. This transfer has the complete "A Love So Fine", some older tapes circulate with this track cut.

1974-10-19 - MEMORIAL CHAPEL CONCERT HALL, UNION COLLEGE, SCHENECTADY, NY

INCIDENT ON 57TH STREET / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / DOES THIS BUS STOP AT 82ND STREET? / THE E STREET SHUFFLE - HAVING A PARTY / IT'S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY / SPANISH HARLEM / LOST IN THE FLOOD / SHE'S THE ONE / JUNGLELAND / KITTY'S BACK / NEW YORK CITY SERENADE / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) / A LOVE SO FINE

One show, held in the intimate Memorial Chapel Concert Hall as part of the school’s Homecoming Weekend, double bill, with Springsteen & The E Street Band headlining. An obscure local four-piece light rock band called Goebel & Lang opened with a 60-minute performance. The concert was a sellout. "A Love So Fine" includes a brief instrumental snippet of "Shout".

The above-mentioned setlist is taken from a circulating audience recording of fair-good quality that likely represents the entire performance. The speed fluctuation problems heard during some songs are from the original source tape. Available on the CD 'New York City Serenade' (Joker-Wildcard) and in slightly weaker sound quality on the CD 'Spanish Harlem' (Piggham). Some songs from this recording have also appeared on various live compilations over the years.

One show, double billing, with Springsteen & The E Street Band headlining and local country-rock band Hange Range opening with a 45-minute set. Interestingly the show was held in the school's 400-seat dining hall, even though there was a larger capacity gymnasium available, in fact Bruce and some members of his entourage were spotted playing basketball in the gym late in the afternoon. The above-mentioned partial setlist is from a review of the show in the campus newspaper. Bruce performed a two-hour show, so there were about four or five songs played but not mentioned in the review. Reports in the newspaper indicate that the College suffered a loss from the concert - costs totalled $5,000, while ticket sales amounted to $1,900.

There is no circulating audio from this gig.

1974-10-25 - SPAULDING AUDITORIUM, DARTMOUTH COLLEGE, HANOVER, NH

Set details unknown. Two shows, both sellouts. Bruce & The E Street Band headline in Spaulding Auditorium with no other act on the bill. Dartmouth was originally scheduled as a single show but demand was such that a second show was added. With no opening act Bruce and the band performed back to back concerts of longer than two hours, with a mere 45-minute break between, making the more than four-hour stage time in one night one of the longest (possibly the longest) two show gigs of the era.

1974-10-26 - JULIA SANDERSON THEATER, SPRINGFIELD, MA

INCIDENT ON 57TH STREET (8.52) / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT (6.08) / DOES THIS BUS STOP AT 82ND STREET? (4.12) / THE E STREET SHUFFLE - HAVING A PARTY (11.55) / IT'S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY (4.03) / JUNGLELAND (9.58) / SHE'S THE ONE (6.29) / KITTY'S BACK (17.20) / NEW YORK CITY SERENADE (16.45) / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) (9.57) / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) (6.24) / A LOVE SO FINE (7.05)

One show, with Springsteen & The E Street Band the sole act on the bill. This gig is often mistakenly listed as having taken place at Springfield College, however there was no school association with this concert. Interestingly "She's The One" begins with a rap that Bruce would use more extensively during the shows in the Fall of 1976: "About, uh....20 years ago....this guy named Ellas McDaniel [a.k.a. Bo Diddley] discovered this beat.....and he found out that whenever he played this beat....educated men, guys that went to school....high school graduates, intellectuals turned into babbling primitives when he played this beat, husbands raped their wives.....to old ´Wagon Train´-repeats, the good girls´d go bad and the bad girls got worse.... This was a pretty serious beat". "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection.

The above-mentioned setlist is culled from an audience tape of fair quality (it distorts at the low end) and represents the entire performance. This tape is available on the CDR 'Back To School' (RCR).

1974-10-27 - PUCILLO GYMNASIUM, MILLERSVILLE UNIVERSITY, MILLERSVILLE, PA

Cancelled Springsteen performance, never rescheduled. This concert was scheduled as one show, double bill, with Springsteen & The E Street Band headlining and Brazilian jazz-fusion legend Eumir Deodato opening. Bruce awoke in the morning with laryngitis from the previous night's performance in Springfield. To compound the problem Millersville was a rare afternoon show, which meant Bruce's voice had six or seven hours less to rejuvenate than normal. Mike Appel was left with the unenviable task of breaking the bad news to the Concert Committee only a few hours before a sold-out show that had been anticipated for weeks and was the key event in the school's 1974 Homecoming Carnival. Appel offered to play the following day but it was apparently not logistically feasible from the school's standpoint. Apparently, posters advertising the gig spelled Bruce's name "Blue Spring Steen." A concert went ahead anyway, with Eumir Deodato providing an extended, three-hour performance to make up for Bruce's non-appearance.

One show with Bruce & The E Street Band headlining. Opening act is Dr. John. Last known version of "Cupid". "She's The One" contains lyrics from "Backstreets". Particularly long versions of "Kitty's Back" and "New York City Serenade", the latter clocking in at over 21 minutes.

Audience tape. Full show is available on CD 'Flesh And Fantasy' (Doberman). Also, three tracks from the show are available on 'And The E Street Band Played' (Scorpio). This show circulated in November 2014 from the famous Boston taper Steve Hopkins' master recording via JEMS, offering great sound and a big upgrade over previous releases of the show, including 'Walking Tall Vol 2' (Ev2). The JEMS master is the source for CDR 'Cupid' (Anubis).

1974-11-01 - TOWER THEATER, UPPER DARBY, PHILADELPHIA, PA

INCIDENT ON 57TH STREET / THEN SHE KISSED ME / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / DOES THIS BUS STOP AT 82ND STREET? / THE E STREET SHUFFLE - HAVING A PARTY / BORN TO RUN / SPANISH HARLEM / IT'S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY / SHE'S THE ONE / JUNGLELAND / KITTY'S BACK / NEW YORK CITY SERENADE / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) / A LOVE SO FINE

One show, with Springsteen & The E Street Band the sole act on the bill. Setlist above corrects and supersedes one previously gleaned from a fairly detailed review in The Villanovan, student newspaper of Villanova University. The 2½ hour set opens with "Incident On 57th Street", with Springsteen accompanied by only Roy Bittan and Suki Lahav. Next up is "Then She Kissed Me", the last known appearance of the song in 1974. It's also worth noting that the show includes "Born To Run. While it has certainly been played regularly since the Bottom Line stand, this is the first time it has been taped since July 13. It's also the last known outing for "Spanish Harlem," likely replaced by Bob Dylan's "I Want You" the next night, as Springsteen notes playing the song at the Tower a couple of days later during a radio interview with WMMR-FM Ed Sciaky. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection. "A Love So Fine" includes a brief instrumental snippet of "Shout".

Because it was only played and captured on tape but a few times (and never as a soundboard or FM), Springsteen's cover of Ben E. King's "Spanish Harlem" has not gotten its due. Like "Incident on 57th Street" and "I Want You" it served as a showcase for Suki Lahav and the beautiful, sweeping arrangement sounds uncannily like the opening bars of a song he would release as an original six years later, "Wreck on the Highway." This show is the first known appearance of the infamous 'police siren' sound effect prop, known to be utilized on this night and also at several shows in November and December at the end of “It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City” and one final time at the February 5, 1975 Main Point gig (at the end of “Incident On 57th Street”).

Audience tape, first circulated in January 2013 via JEMS and recorded by The Big A, also released on 'Spanish Harlem Incident On Philly'. An almost complete tape, with just one small tape-swap edit in the 21-minute "New York City Serenade".

1974-11-02 - TOWER THEATER, UPPER DARBY, PHILADELPHIA, PA

SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / BORN TO RUN / JUNGLELAND / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) / A LOVE SO FINE

One show, with Springsteen & The E Street Band the sole act on the bill. Perhaps because Springsteen knew he was going to debut a studio demo of the song the following night on WMMR-FM, this show at Tower Theater included a rare (at the time) performance of “Born To Run”. Critic Buzz Cerino’s review of this show notes that several new, then-unreleased songs were performed and although he doesn’t mention its title by name the inclusion of “Born To Run” in this show has been confirmed by then Tower Theater manager (and promoter ‘Midnight Sun’ co-owner) Stuart Green. "She's The One" and "Jungleland" are also likely to be included in the set.

1974-11-03 - RADIO STATION WMMR-FM, PHILADELPHIA, PA

On the eve of a bus trip to Texas, Springsteen (along with Garry Tallent, new E Street Band members Max Weinberg and Roy Bittan, as well as Bruce's then-girlfriend) visits DJ Ed Sciaky for an hour of record spinning, chat and general clowning around that may be the most insightful interview Bruce has ever given. Sciaky asks Bruce some interesting questions, resulting in a substantial amount of unique historical detail. Bruce jokingly performs an on-air ad for Suntory Akadama red wine, he talks in detail about "If I Was The Priest" and "The Fever" (Sciaky plays both songs, the former being Allan Clarke's cover version). Bruce is somewhat disparaging about the former, saying "I thought I'd burned every copy", and explaining how he could never play it live again. Sciaky also got the mother of all "scoops", with a studio version of "Born To Run" receiving a world debut airing eight months prior to its official release. Within a couple of weeks of this show, Kid Leo (WMMS-FM in Cleveland), Scott Muni (WNEW-FM in New York) and Maxanne Sartori (WBCN-FM in Boston) are also sent broadcast copies of the song by Mike Appel. By early 1975, another twenty stations receive the tape, thereby creating a nightmare for CBS because many hundreds of stations can't obtain the tape.

Nearly all the essential segments of this show can be found on the two-CD set 'Northeast On The Dial' (Mystic).

Soundcheck: SHE'S THE ONE / A LOVE SO FINE / JUNGLELAND

SHE'S THE ONE / A LOVE SO FINE / JUNGLELAND

No complete details known. The concert was originally planned to be held at the Alumni Gymnasium but was moved to the larger Kirby Field House when ticket sales rose above 750. The concert cost the College $5,900 and damage to the Field House caused by smoking and drinking reduced their profits to almost zero. 1,200 of the 2,122 available tickets were sold on campus. Springsteen and the band played for 2½ hours, and a fan present reports "Clarence invited us in for the sound check and they played "She's The One", "A Love So Fine" and "Jungleland". I had never seen any of these before and there only about 20 of us there, dancing. He played them during the show." The scheduled support was a country-rock band called Slim Pickins, but they did not appear due to illness.

One show, held in Leonard Gym, with Springsteen & the E Street Band the sole act on the bill. The 14-song setlist above seems to represent the complete show. Current evidence suggests this show included Bruce’s debut of Elvis’s "Wear My Ring Around Your Neck", which would turn up during encores for the next month. A Brucebase reader comments: “the best rock show I've ever seen and the best of the 12 Springsteen shows I've seen from '73 - '96. The show was so great it could have cured a terminal disease". Another reader comments: "it was my first Bruce show and it blew me away. Bruce came out and gave a 'there are contenders, there are pretenders but there was only one King of rock 'n roll' speech and proceeded into an Elvis song during which he fell to the floor and did the horizontal Curly Shuffle, doing circles on the floor with leg kicks. Amazing, made me a fan for life". Yet another Brucebase reader comments: "It truly was a life-altering event. I ran back home to Philly and drove to the War Memorial show a few days later to see if what I had just witnessed was an aberration… and of course it wasn't. That was it for me". The school’s Yearbook mistakenly dates this show as November 23, 1975.

An audience tape (not widely circulating) exists with all tracks except the final two.

One show, held in 1200-seat Memorial Gymnasium, with Bruce & The E Street Band the sole act on the bill. A couple of hundred tickets remained unsold. Complete setlist details are not known but the above-mentioned songs are noted as having been performed in separate reviews of the gig published in the local papers the following day. Former James Gang and future Eagles lead guitarist Joe Walsh attended this show, although the Springsteen camp was unaware of it at the time.

New Jersey rocker John Eddie, whose gigs Springsteen would later guest at, has mentioned this night was the first time he’d ever seen Springsteen perform live, further commenting: “that’s when I realized you could be theatrical and rock 'n' roll, and not have to wear women’s clothing.”

1974-11-22 - HOLLINGER FIELD HOUSE, WEST CHESTER COLLEGE, WEST CHESTER, PA

INCIDENT ON 57TH STREET / JUNGLELAND

No other set details known. One show, double bill, with Springsteen headlining and folk stylist Jae Mason opening. A Brucebase reader who attended comments: "A truly amazing show. I took a friend who only listened to classical music and couldn't stand rock... even she was blown away! Jae Mason opened up and the crowd booed him. So Bruce came out and asked the crowd to give the guy a break because it wasn't too long ago that he (Bruce) was an opening act. Suki Lahav was playing. The rendition of "Jungleland" was one of the greatest moments in rock and roll history!" A review in the college Quad magazine states that "Incident On 57th Street" opened the set, with Bruce accompanied by piano and Suki on the violin. The review notes that the MCs introduction was simply "Ladies and gentlemen, a man you will never forget, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band." The reviewer's final paragraphs are worth repeating here; "His expressions, his motions, the subtlety of his repetition, the raunchy power of his screaming guitar, the sensual rasp of the sax, the fragile piano, the heartbeat of the drums, the bleeding cry of the violin, the omniscience of the organ, all add up to the amazing presence somewhere between greaser and punk that is Springsteen. Springsteen's music is pure Rock 'N Roll unlike anything you've heard before, but then it's everything you've heard before. Every rock tune before Springsteen was looking for a final statement, the ultimate expression of an ultimate goal, trying to synthesize emotion and intellect as only Rock 'N Roll could do. Springsteen is everything Rock 'N Roll should have been."

1974-11-26 - RADIO STATION WMMR-FM, PHILADELPHIA, PA

A bit of a legendary 24 hours in the Springsteen diary. Late on the evening of November 24 Bruce catches a bus from Asbury Park to Philadelphia to spend a couple of days as houseguest of DJ Ed Sciaky. Ed had phoned Bruce earlier that day asking him to come to Philly to meet David Bowie, who was in town recording an album and performing a show. Sciaky and Bruce arrived at midnight and spent the early hours of November 25 with Bowie at Sigma Sound Studios. Bowie had recently recorded a cover of “It’s Hard To Be A Saint In The City” but apparently it wasn’t finished, so Bruce didn’t get to hear it. (It would remain in the vaults until the early '90s when Bowie finally released it).

Later that same day (November 25) Springsteen and Sciaky attend Bowie’s evening concert at the Philadelphia Spectrum, though Springsteen does not play. Immediately following the Bowie concert Sciaky and Springsteen take a cab to the Philadelphia Academy Of Music to catch the second (late) show of a Janis Ian / Billy Joel double bill. Bruce does not guest perform here either. Following this show Sciaky, Joel and Springsteen headed to the Eagle II diner in Philly for a 1am dinner. When they get to the restaurant they're surprised to find that Barry Manilow (who’d also attended the Joel show) has just arrived as well. Barry, like Bruce and Billy, was a friend of Ed Sciaky’s, so the four of them, Springsteen-Joel-Manilow-Sciaky (and Ed's wife) end up dining together.

Later that afternoon (November 26) Bruce records a Christmas message for Sciaky at WMMR (available on the boot “The Bruce Springsteen Collection, Vol 2”).

One show at 7:30pm, with Springsteen & The E Street Band the sole act on the bill. Brucebase reader Dick comments: "Bruce opened with a semi-solo version of “Incident On 57th Street”, bathed in a blue spotlight with the violinist eventually joining in”. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection, and "A Love So Fine" includes a brief instrumental snippet of "Shout". The show includes the infamous 'police siren' sound effect prop, utilized on this night and the next three shows at the end of “It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City”. The first known use of the prop was at the Tower Theater in Philadelphia on November 1.

Two recording sources circulate, the above-mentioned 15-song setlist is from an audience tape of reasonable quality and represents the complete performance. It can be found in its entirety on the CDR 'I Want You' (Piggham) and also via the Kivak Master Series as 'From The Churches To The Jails'. A second source entered circulation from the master tapes (The Big A) via JEMS in August 2014. This source is a very good recording missing the last four songs as the taper was caught taping from the second row. The Kivak master tapes are available complete using a patch to 'Kitty's Back' from the The Big A source. This is the earliest circulating audio of Dylan's "I Want You", although Springsteen had mentioned during the November 3 radio interview that he had already performed it live, in fact DJ Ed Sciaky mentions it was performed the previous night at Tower Theatre.

One show, with Springsteen & The E Street Band the sole act on the bill. "It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City" includes a spoken rap portion, as well as the police siren prop during the instrumental. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection. "A Love So Fine" includes an instrumental snippet of "Shout". The unidentified instrumental tune showcased during the encores isn't known to have been performed at any other show. According to a fan present, " when Bruce did the instrumental at the State Theatre in New Brunswick, it was because he broke his guitar string and was changing it on stage, and the band played the instrumental".

The above-mentioned 16-song setlist is taken from an audience tape of fair quality (it runs slow) and represents the complete performance. A remaster of the show from the master cassettes has corrected the speed and upgraded the sound where possible, released as 'So Glad To Be Home' (Kivak Master Series).

One show, double bill with Springsteen & the E Street Band headlining and folk stylist Jae Mason opening, albeit with a short, thirty-minute set. Booked by the nearby Hobart & William Smith College. "It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City" includes a spoken rap portion, as well as the police siren prop during the instrumental. "Jungleland" is one of the earliest versions including some lyrics that were later discarded. Clarence Clemons takes lead vocals on "Gimme That Wine", which appears in the set once again when Springsteen breaks a guitar string and needs time to change it, leaving the band to vamp until his return. This sixteen-song set includes possibly the longest "New York City Serenade" known, clocking in at over twenty-four minutes. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection. "A Love So Fine" includes an instrumental snippet of "Shout".

The complete set list is now confirmed via a newly circulated audience tape mastered by JEMS.

Although held off campus in the commercial Burlington Memorial Auditorium, this was an official University of Vermont event (sponsored by the UVM After School Concert Program). A scheduling conflict had prevented the show from taking place in the school’s primary concert venue, Patrick Gymnasium. Standard set for this period. Excellent "It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City" and unusual "The E Street Shuffle". "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection. "A Love So Fine" includes an instrumental snippet of "Shout".

An audience tape exists. "New York City Serenade" is a good version but is spoilt by tape warble and cuts at the start.

1974-12-14 - AUDITORIUM, RUTGERS UNIVERSITY, NEW BRUNSWICK, NJ

TWIST AND SHOUT

Bruce attends a second Billy Joel concert (see November 25 for details on Bruce's previous concert visit). During the show Billy paused to dedicate the song 'The Entertainer" to Springsteen and then, for the third encore, Bruce joined Joel onstage for an impromptu version of "Twist And Shout". A Brucebase reader who attended comments: "Before the show my friends and I decided to walk over to the men's locker room and snap a few pictures of Billy as he emerged to go onstage. The quickest way to get there was to walk underneath the bleachers. I remember seeing a scruffy guy sitting huddled with his back against the wall under the bleachers. It seemed odd, as the show was about to begin. It did not strike me until the next day that this scruffy guy huddled in the shadows was in fact Bruce trying to keep low key." A second attendee has this to say: "The weird thing about that night was all of a sudden everybody starts whispering across the front row “Springsteen’s here! Springsteen’s here”. I look at my cousin Anthony who was a Rutgers student thus the great seats, and actually say to him "Who the fuck is Springsteen?” A few minutes later Billy said “I want to introduce you guys to another Columbia artist who’s also been banging around trying to make it, he’s currently working on his next album - Bruce Springsteen!”. So Bruce comes out and it looks like he had just left the Born To Run photo shoot with the same leather jacket, hat and shirt that he wore on that famous cover. So they light into the Isley Brothers version of "Twist And Shout". The strange thing about Springsteen for me is it seemed like the guy had an actual electric aura around him while he was performing, I had never seen anything like that before or since. I swear you could almost SEE it like a Keith Haring cartoon character!!! So they do the song and after it’s done I lean over to my cousin Anthony and say “Oh, so THAT’S Springsteen” I’ve been a fan ever since that night.

1974-12-14 - MULTIPURPOSE ROOM, STUDENT CENTER, RUTGERS UNIVERSITY, NEW BRUNSWICK, NJ

No set details known. Following his guest appearance with Billy Joel at the main Rutgers concert auditorium (see above listing) Springsteen walks across campus to the school’s Student Center and jams with Sid Gottlieb’s band Heavy Trucking. This took place after midnight, so technically speaking it was on December 15. Heavy Trucking had previously opened for Bruce at a concert at Rutgers on April 1, 1973. Peter Wyman, who worked for Rutgers University Major Events Programs at the time, has commented to Brucebase “after the (Billy Joel) encore Bruce was by a back door and asked me what the quickest way to the Student Center was. I walked him there and he told me he wanted to play with Heavy Trucking, they did five or six songs together”.

Brucebase reader Ron Gompertz takes up the story: "I walked over to the Student Center from my dorm room that evening, and ended up downstairs where the bowling alleys were looking to get a soda. I saw my friend Dirk, drummer with the Heavy Trucking band. I'd come over to see Heavy Trucking do sound check, and Dirk and two or three band mates were watching a guy knocking a pinball machine hard and racking up a lot of points. At close range and standing next to him, I noticed his oddly protruding lower jaw. Slowly I realized who it was. Bruce. I leaned over to Dirk and said, is that who I think it is. Dirk nodded.

I'd seen Springsteen in concert three or four times by then, but never so close up. After a couple of games, Dirk, HT guitarist Sid Gottlieb, Bruce and I walked upstairs to the Multi-Purpose Room, a large room with folding chairs lined up against the walls. The center of the floor was wide open for dancing... and Heavy Trucking was nothing if not a dance band. I sat down at the back wall, and Bruce sat next to me as Heavy Trucking did sound check. Bruce wasn't very talkative... he seemed distant as I tried to engage him in conversation every few minutes or so. I asked about his next album and how it were going. He said it was taking a long time and there were hassles. I told him my girlfriend, Lori, had a big crush on him and his poster hanging in her dorm room and he seemed embarrassed. After a while Bruce said, "I gotta go across the street to the Billy Joel show. My manager wants me to play. We're on the same label."

When he left, I called girlfriend Lori on a pay phone and told her to "get over here right away" if she wanted to meet Bruce. Lori arrived, and shortly after, Bruce settling back into the same folding chair next to me. Lori was sitting on my lap, and I introduced them. I said something sarcastic about Billy Joel being from Long Island and Bruce nodded a bit. Heavy Trucking played their set (Shake Your Money Maker, Chuck Berry cover songs) while the room full of people danced. Nobody seemed to notice Bruce. Then Sid announced a special guest, and Bruce got up and walked to the stage. Picking up a guitar, they played a set of covers. Lori and I, along with the hundred or so other lucky people in the room danced with big grins on our faces. I don't recall the songs. Wish I did.

After the show, Lori and I hung around with the band as they broke down equipment. Bruce hung around too, messing around on a baby grand piano, playing something that sounded vaguely familiar. Lori now remembers Bruce telling her to sing along with him, but she was too shy. Bruce played some instrumental piano music, and it may have been Thunder Road. I'm really not sure. It was late by the time we all left."

1974-12-20 - RADIO STATION WPLJ-FM, NEW YORK CITY, NY

At the request of John Hammond, Bruce visits the studios of WPLJ-FM (formally WABC-FM) for an interview with Father Bill Ayers, a Catholic priest who hosted an hour-long Sunday radio show called ‘On This Rock’ that mixed rock star interviews, spirituality and social action.

The entire Springsteen interview was over 60 minutes but it was edited down to about 30 minutes of material for the show. This was a delayed broadcast, the Springsteen segment first aired as part of Father Bill’s April 15, 1975 program. Only the interview segments broadcast by WPLJ-FM circulate.

One show, held as a benefit for the ~270-seat coffeehouse, with Springsteen & The E Street Band the sole act on the bill. The show was emceed by DJ Ed Sciaky and began just after 9.00pm. It was broadcast by WMMR-FM, but not as a true simulcast, rather it was broadcast on about a two-hour delay the same night. Interestingly, Springsteen almost backed out of his promise to allow the show to be broadcast. He wanted to play new songs that were still unfinished - songs that may not be ready for a large radio audience. It took a concentrated effort by Sciaky on the day of the concert to talk Bruce around. An attendee review of the show from 1975 by critic David Fricke states the show took place on February 3, but this appears to be an error by Fricke given detailed interview comments by Sciaky and the recollections of other attendees. Press reports suggest that Springsteen raised over $1,000 for the Main Point.

The complete show was broadcast and the above-noted 18-song setlist represents the entire concert. Not only is it one of the longest (160 minutes) single-show gigs up to this point but it's one of the most compelling performances of Springsteen's entire career. There are spellbinding renditions of "Incident On 57th Street", "New York City Serenade" and "For You" (in the solo piano arrangement), the earliest known performances of "Mountain Of Love" and "Thunder Road" (with work-in-progress "Wings For Wheels" title/lyrics) plus a wild, majestic version of Chuck Berry's "Back In The U.S.A.". "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection. Contrary to myth the police siren heard at the conclusion of “Incident On 57th Street” is an audio prop that had been utilized at a few of Bruce’s shows just prior to this one, i.e. it was not a real vehicle.

This famous show circulated on vinyl boots and tapes from the mid-'70s onwards, but rarely the entire show (early vinyl boots were missing the final six songs in the setlist) and always in variable quality. The entire performance was first issued in 1990 in good sound quality on the CD ‘The Saint, The Incident & The Main Point Shuffle' by the Italian label Great Dane. Soon after, an incomplete pre-FM reel of the first ninety minutes was discovered and the show was issued in improved quality on CD 'The Saint, The Incident & The Main Point Shuffle - Masters Plus' (also Great Dane), ‘You Can Trust Your Car To The Man Who Wears The Star’ (Labor of Love) and most recently (and in the finest overall quality yet) on CDR 'Prodigal Son At The Main Point' (a remaster of the Great Dane 'Masters Plus' release by Prodigal Son) and CD ‘Main Point Night’ (Crystal Cat). Part of the concert was legally released to retail in the UK in 2005 by American Legends Limited as 'Live On Air', reissued in 2007 by Storming as 'Transmissions', reissued again in 2010 by Southworld as 'Live On Air', and reissued again in 2011 by Facerock as 'The Best "Live On Air" Of Bruce Springsteen'. The complete show was released in 2011 by Left Field Media as a two-CD set titled 'Live At The Main Point, 1975', by Let Them Eat Vinyl (under exclusive agreement with Left Field Media) as a four-LP box set titled 'Live At The Main Point 1975', and in 2014 by Parallel Lines as part of a three-CD set titled 'The Spirit Of The Radio: Legendary Broadcasts From The Early 1970s' that also includes a CD containing the January 9, 1973 WBCN-FM and April 24, 1973 WMMR-FM radio broadcasts. None of these releases are officially issued by Sony, rather by enterprising record labels taking advantage of a legal loophole which allows the commercial release of pre-1992 radio broadcasts that emanate from non-signatories of the 1992 EU Copyright Convention.

As to why the audio quality of the final 63 minutes of this show (from around eight minutes into "Kitty's Back" onwards) are inferior to the first 90 minutes, it seems that the early part of the show was sourced from pre-broadcast reels (or copies of them), while the latter part of the show is sourced from a recording of the broadcast itself. In an interview in Backstreets magazine #82 Ed Sciaky offers some important information, "We didn't have a phone line from the Main Point, so they had to tape the show in hour-long segments and then drive them to the station and put them on the air... and after the final reel had played, Bruce's lighting guy Marc Brickman (lighting director) took all of the tapes. So we (WMMR) never got a good copy of the show”. The concert broadcast was also likely to have been subjected to some kind of auto-limiter, designed to limit the volume difference between loud and quiet segments. Unfortunately, the effect (variations in volume) is audible throughout the FM broadcast segment. In July 2011 the final 63 minutes finally emerged in improved quality, A home-taping enthusiast from Philadelphia recorded the concert on reel at 3-3/4 IPS (inches per second), and the result is a significant upgrade. The quality may not quite match the pre-FM segment, but it is the best we can expect unless a pre-FM source of the last hour should be found. A promotion-only 7” flexidisc issued to subscribers of Austrian pop magazine Rennbahn Express in June 1981 contains Sciaky’s introduction from this show, albeit edited to avoid references to WMMR and The Main Point.

1975-02-06 - WIDENER FIELD HOUSE, WIDENER COLLEGE, CHESTER, PA

INCIDENT ON 57TH STREET (8.26) / MOUNTAIN OF LOVE (3.12) / BORN TO RUN (4.33) / THE E STREET SHUFFLE / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT (6.44) / I WANT YOU / WINGS FOR WHEELS (6.18) / GROWIN' UP / IT'S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY / JUNGLELAND / KITTY'S BACK (11.41) / NEW YORK CITY SERENADE (2.57) / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) (1.10) / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) (7:09) / BACK IN THE U.S.A / FOR YOU

One show, held in the 1,500-seat Widener Field House, with Springsteen & The E Street Band the sole act on the bill. This first of two consecutive nights at Widener was not quite a sellout. Due to the notoriously bad sound in the school's Field House, Mike Appel had engaged a local contractor to install echo-suppressing material along the walls and roof of the Gymnasium. A few hours before the show Appel learned that this material was highly flammable and a mad scramble ensued to re-position the material to be out of possible reach of the crowd. This caused the start of the opening night's show to be delayed for over 90 minutes. The material functioned reasonably well and the over-two-hour show was a roaring success. The school's newspaper reported that Suki Lahav had to be treated for exhaustion after this show, although she recuperated in time for the following night's performance. The 16-song setlist listed above is sourced from the video and newspaper reviews and may be the complete set, although it is possible that one or two songs are missing and it's likely that the order is not correct. As noted in the Montgomery Gazette, "Incident On 57th Street" opened the show, and a two-song encore of "Back In The U.S.A." and "For You" (played by Springsteen alone at the piano) brought the proceedings to a close. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection.

Video from this show has been in circulation since the late 1970s (portions of the film footage are said to have been circulating among the Widener community as early as 1976) and the detail surrounding its origin has long been a source of speculation. For many years, the circulating quality of the footage was uniformly poor. However, portions of the video were shown in Springsteen TV documentaries in the '90s and the quality was significantly better than anything seen before. Since then, upgraded versions have made their way into DVD trading circles, but the quality still doesn't quite match up to what has been seen in documentaries. This has lent credence to a long-held rumour that this footage (far from emanating from a shadowy fan) may have been shot by Widener students involved in a film-making course and that there may have been some pre-arranged conditional approval to film the concert from the Springsteen camp. In truth, the two shooters, M and J, weren't students at all, but a couple of Springsteen fans, the father of one of which had purchased a Sony Portapak video recorder for use in his business. On a lark, the friends borrowed the camera and open-reel recorder and thought they would try their luck filming a show by their favorite musician, without permission. They only had enough tape and batteries to record a little over an hour, but shoot they did without incurring any unwanted attention from security or management. That clicking you hear in spots on the video is the pair shooting still photos, too, as they took turns holding up the relatively heavy video camera. The pair only ever shot one other artist before ending their careers as concert videographers. For years after the show the pair would thread up the video to show at parties and they eventually made a copy for the late WMMR DJ Ed Sciaky, from which it is presumed the circulating copies emanated. There has long been uncertainty about exactly which of the two Widener shows was filmed from the crowd. For some time it has been believed that the video was sourced from the second show (February 7), however recent comparison of the video and the newly discovered audio detailed in the February 7 listing has established that they are not sourced from the same concert. Further discussions with the filmer and the audio taper has confirmed without doubt that the video was shot at the first show (February 6). The video is comprised of the nine songs above that are listed with their running times, plus a very brief snippet from the introduction to "I Want You".

1975-02-07 - WIDENER FIELD HOUSE, WIDENER COLLEGE, CHESTER, PA

4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) / A LOVE SO FINE - SHOUT / FOR YOU / WEAR MY RING AROUND YOUR NECK

One show, held in the 1,500-seat Widener Field House, with Springsteen & The E Street Band the sole act on the bill. This second night at Widener was a sellout.

The recently added setlist above is culled from a newly discovered audio recording of the encore made by another party. The new source tape starts with "4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)" and features a stunning solo piano version of "For You".

1975-02-18 - JOHN CARROLL GYM, JOHN CARROLL UNIVERSITY, CLEVELAND, OH

INCIDENT ON 57TH STREET / GROWIN' UP / WINGS FOR WHEELS / BORN TO RUN

No other set details known. One show, with Springsteen & The E Street Band the sole act on the bill, and held in the 2,000-seat John Carroll University Gymnasium. This concert was originally scheduled for February 27 but moved forward due to a studio session booked at The Record Plant in New York City. Beginning at 8:30pm, the concert began with WMMS DJ Kid Leo's introduction before Springsteen's first song "Incident On 57th Street". According to the University's campus newspaper The Carroll News, "Growin' Up" was the third song of the set, while those present recall both "Thunder Road" (in its early "Wings For Wheels" form) and "Born To Run". A Brucebase reader who attended comments that he and his fellow University Club fraternity members sold tickets, helped set up the stage and the band's equipment, sat through the soundcheck, and ushered the concert. The event was organized by Tim Russert, a 1972 JCU graduate and former University Club president, Russert was later known in the U.S. as host of NBC-TV's "Meet The Press" and became a close friend of Springsteen's. Bruce and the band were paid $2,500 for the night's work, and Russert even worked as a roadie, helping out the fraternity members. Russert said a few years back in an interview, “I made enough money (from the concert) to pay for my second year of law school.

One show, double bill, with Springsteen & The E Street Band headlining and Jae Mason opening. Springsteen’s first-ever show at Penn State (two scheduled appearances in 1973 had been cancelled). The above-mentioned 19-song setlist, which is likely to be complete, or near to, is taken from an attendee recollection combined with information articulated in reviews of the gig in two college newspapers. It's likely that this setlist is not in the correct song order. "For You" is performed solo piano.

No known audio.

1975-02-20 - SYRIA MOSQUE, PITTSBURGH, PA

No set details known. One show, double bill, with Springsteen & The E Street Band co-headlining with Richie Havens (who opened). This was an official school event (sponsored by the University of Pittsburgh Program Council) but held off-campus in the nearby Syria Mosque. Havens and his entourage were late arriving into Pittsburgh from the previous night’s gig, so the show’s start was delayed for over an hour. Rich Engler was the promoter for the show, and in his book Behind the Stage Door: A Promoter’s Life Behind The Scenes, he writes:

"I had been hearing about this act, Bruce Springsteen from Asbury Park, N.J. who was supposed to be the next big thing. John Kostick, a rep from CBS Records, played me an advance copy of “Born to Run,” and it was obvious that it was going to be a huge hit. I booked a show with Bruce at the Syria Mosque in early 1975, and in no time we had a sellout. The concert was fabulous; everything I had heard about Bruce as a performer was true. He commanded the stage and drove the fans into a frenzy. They were singing along to even the most obscure Springsteen songs, and it was obvious a star was being born. Every now and then, an act comes along that just has it all. Bruce was one of those.

John Kostick asked if Cindy and I would like to join him and Bruce for a bite to eat after the concert. They were headed to Cleveland for another show. I called Carmassi’s, an Italian restaurant we went to on occasion, to make sure it was going to be open late. The owner, Sonny Carmassi, assured me we could dine there. When the four of us arrived, the door was locked. I knocked, Sonny came out, looked at us, and pulled me inside the restaurant. “Listen Rich, I can let the three of you in but not that other guy. He’s not dressed properly.” Bruce was wearing a wife beater, jeans, and sandals. “What do you mean? Do you know who that is? That’s Bruce Springsteen!” “Who’s Bruce Springsteen? I don’t care who he is, he can’t come in the restaurant dressed like that.”

After much pleading, Sonny let us in. I told him that after we ate he should frame Bruce’s place setting, put it on the wall and people would come in just to look at it. Sonny didn’t believe that Bruce would be a superstar, however, we were able to have dinner. The waiter came and took our orders. Bruce had the most unusual order…corn on the cob for dinner and then later, apple pie.
Shortly after that, Bruce’s picture was on the cover of Newsweek and Time magazines. I called Sonny to be sure he kept the place setting, but he hadn’t. He never realized how big a star had dined in his restaurant. We still laugh about it today."

INCIDENT ON 57TH STREET (8.09) / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT (6.02) / BORN TO RUN (4.11) / THE E STREET SHUFFLE - HAVING A PARTY (cut, 11.29) / GROWIN' UP (2.48) / IT'S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY (4.23) / I WANT YOU (6.10) / SHE'S THE ONE (6.06) / JUNGLELAND (9.27) / KITTY'S BACK (cut, 12.27) / NEW YORK CITY SERENADE (16.30) / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) (9.53) / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) (6.50) / A LOVE SO FINE - SHOUT (8.38) / FOR YOU (7.22) / WEAR MY RING AROUND YOUR NECK (2.15) / QUARTER TO THREE (5.08)

One show, double bill, with Springsteen headlining and Jae Mason opening. This is an extraordinary performance, similar in scope to the February 5 gig at The Main Point. Amazingly, it was not even close to a sellout. Westbury was a revolving stage performance (as were the 1974 Phoenix gigs). To accentuate the atmosphere Bruce ordered Mike Appel to install a functioning Ferris Wheel on stage as an effect prop, the plan was scrapped only at the last moment, after Appel told Bruce that the cost was going to be more than their performance fee. A Brucebase reader who attended comments: "the stage would turn once to the right and then back all the way to the left. Sitting in the back you had to wait for Bruce to come around again. During the encores the stage stopped, that's why you can hear people yelling 'turn the stage' near the end of the show". "Kitty's Back" includes a snippet of "Soothe Me" in the midsection. "New York City Serenade" includes a bit of "Backstreets" in the introduction. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection. "For You" is the solo piano version.

The above-mentioned 17-song setlist (plus soundcheck) is taken from a reasonable quality audience recording and represents the complete show. It can be found on the CDR 'Westbury Music Fair', CD "The Greatest Performance' (Parrot) and also CDR 'Westbury Serenade' (Fanatic) from the master cassettes.

One show, double bill, with Springsteen & The E Street Band headlining and Buzzy Linhart opening. "Born To Run" is the recollection of an attendee, and does not appear on the audience tape. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection. Brucebase reader Paul attended the show, and recalls that there were two or three guys dressed as monks in the audience. They sported Friar Tuck haircuts and wore robes, one in white and the others in brown. During one of the songs toward the end of the set, one of the brown robes came on stage and gave Bruce his knotted girth rope. In a Baltimore Sun interview, Bruce called him the freaky friar. Two nights later while waiting to get in outside Constitution Hall, Paul saw the group again.

Partial setlist above is from a circulating audio tape and represents about half the night's performance, missing several songs played during the middle part of the show.

One show, double bill, with Springsteen & The E Street Band headlining and Orleans opening. Two audience sources are known, the first four songs circulate complete from a very poor quality tape. A second very good quality source cuts in during "I Want You" and contains a further eight songs including "New York City Serenade". "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection. "For You" is the solo piano version.

Audience tape (Unbooted). "Wear Your Ring Around My Neck" does not appear on some copies of this tape. Three separate sources appear to exist: a low quality tape comprising "Incident On 57th Street" through "I Want You", a good quality tape covering the middle of "I Want You" through "For You", and a final good quality tape of the last two songs, which is most likely of this show.

INCIDENT ON 57TH STREET / I WANT YOU / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / JUNGLELAND / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) / WINGS FOR WHEELS / WEAR MY RING AROUND YOUR NECK

One show, double bill, with Springsteen & the E Street Band headlining and Orleans opening. Fittingly this was the final gig of the long Wild & Innocent Tour, which had begun here in Washington way back in October 1973. A partial setlist (above) is known from attendee recollections. This would turn out to be violinist Tzruya "Suki" Lahav’s final live guest appearance with Springsteen, although she participated in the Born To Run studio sessions that followed this tour. Suki (along with then-husband Louis) moved to Israel permanently later in 1975. At the time of this show a few other possible concerts for March-April were being negotiated by manager Mike Appel, including one at Notre Dame University. It seems the priority of the new album sessions won out and the majority of the gig negotiations were abandoned before any contracts were signed.

No circulating audio.

1975-03-13 - ALEX COOLEY'S ELECTRIC BALLROOM, ATLANTA, GA

Cancelled show, rescheduled to August 21. One of three dates planned at the Electric Ballroom with Springsteen & the E Street Band headlining and English rock band The Pretty Things opening. Springsteen was first listed as a "Coming Soon" attraction in a January 23, 1975 advertisement in The Signal, student newspaper of Georgia State University. The gigs were then advertised in the February 13, 1975 issue of The Great Speckled Bird, an underground counter-culture newspaper based in Atlanta as well as The Signal. However, by the following week the dates had been cancelled, presumably due to ongoing studio sessions, with KISS taking Springsteen's place. An advertisement in the March 13 issue shows that Kiss themselves were eventually replaced by country-rock band Cowboy and undercard Isotope, a British jazz-rock band.

1975-05-09 - FELT FORUM, MADISON SQUARE GARDEN, NEW YORK CITY, NY

Cancelled, never rescheduled. One show, 8pm. A Madison Square Garden "Coming Events" leaflet indicates that this show was scheduled. It was cancelled, presumably due to recording sessions for the Born To Run album. This date could well be one of the shows that Mike Appel was negotiating (see March 9 listing), but never signed. The leaflet advertises events from March 10, so may have been printed towards the end of February. Felt Forum was the original name for the venue now known as The Theater at Madison Square Garden.

Soundcheck: NEEDLES AND PINS / YOU REALLY GOT ME / CRY TO ME / LET THE FOUR WINDS BLOW / SOOTHE ME / NEW YORK CITY SERENADE / (YOUR LOVE KEEPS LIFTING ME) HIGHER AND HIGHER (Total Time 18.43)

INCIDENT ON 57TH STREET (7.15) / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT (6.13) / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT (3.28) / GROWIN' UP (3.11) / IT'S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY (4.15) / THE E STREET SHUFFLE - HAVING A PARTY (11.04) / SHE'S THE ONE (4.30) / BORN TO RUN (4.01) / KITTY'S BACK (14.32) / NEW YORK CITY SERENADE (cut, 14.24) / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) (cut, 11.58) / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) (6.23) / A LOVE SO FINE - SOOTHE ME - BABY WORKOUT - SHOUT (10.32) / SHA-LA-LA (2.34) / QUARTER TO THREE (cut, 0.56)

The arrangement of “(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher” is different to later concert versions. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes a brief "Come A Little Bit Closer" intro and a snippet of Isaac Hayes' "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection, but cuts out during the band introductions. This concert had originally been scheduled for July 12, but then moved forward to July 11. However, due to delays in completing the new album, this gig was first bumped back to July 18 and then delayed again and played on July 22. Tickets for July 12 were never used; a new set was printed for July 11 and then changed by hand. During the show Bruce jokes to the crowd about new member Miami Steve messing up his parts in the songs, lyrics and dance steps.

Audience tape of both the show and soundcheck. The circulating audience tape is missing the opening number. The soundcheck audio is very muddy but includes complete versions of The Kinks "You Really Got Me" and the great Solomon Burke's "Cry To Me".

1975-07-23 - MUSIC INN, LENOX, MA

SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT / GROWIN' UP / IT'S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY / THE E STREET SHUFFLE - HAVING A PARTY / SHE'S THE ONE / GIMME THAT WINE / BORN TO RUN / THUNDER ROAD / FUNK SONG / KITTY'S BACK / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) / A LOVE SO FINE - SHOUT / SHA-LA-LA / QUARTER TO THREE

This show includes a couple of rarities: one of only three known renditions of “Gimme That Wine” (previously played on March 10, 1974 and December 7, 1974), and secondly the first circulating in-concert performance of “Funk Song”, an early Springsteen-composed instrumental that had been a staple of The Bruce Springsteen Band in 1971-72 (no live renditions from that era are circulating, but a rehearsal take from early 1972 is). Interestingly “Funk Song” would be performed on two other known occasions during the following two weeks (July 28 and August 8), but seemingly never again after that. Unusually "Spirit In The Night" opens the set, rather than "Incident On 57th Street" which has been ever-present in the opening slot so far this year. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection. "Thunder Road" is full band. A Brucebase reader who attended this concert comments: “it was outdoors in a natural amphitheater. The show didn't start until just before sunset, so we were treated to this amazing changing backdrop, from full light at the outset, through a spectacular, fiery sunset and then ending up in darkness with Bruce’s typical great use of stage lighting. Bruce broke a guitar string and he didn't have any backup. That's what caused the band to perform "Gimme That Wine". While the band played Bruce re-strung his guitar on stage. Miami Steve performed the soundcheck and the first half of the show without anything on his head, don't believe that's happened since!” Click the link above for a review from Yale University's Daily News.

The above-mentioned 16-song setlist is the complete performance and is culled from an audience tape of average quality. The show is available in best quality on CDR 'The Complete Lenox, The Complete Makeover' (Fanatic). Some versions of this tape run fast, the aforementioned release has been speed-corrected. This show (at least in part) was filmed by early Springsteen fan Barry Rebo; with a short clip turning up in the official Wings For Wheels documentary DVD more than 30 years after the fact. Video of "The E Street Shuffle" was shown by Thom Zimny at the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame discussion in June 2009. A clip of the band taking the stage can also be seen in Working on a Dream: A Super Bowl Journal, a documentary broadcast in September 2009.

"The E Street Shuffle" includes "It's All Right" in the introduction and "Having A Party" in the outro. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection. "A Love So Fine" includes a passage from the Isley Brothers' "Shout." A fan recalls "I was at either the 25 or July 26 show at Kutztown, PA. The memorable thing about this show was that they had filled the gym floor with blue folding chairs for seating. During the show everyone was standing on the chairs jumping and dancing. When the show was over at least 1/3 of the chairs had collapsed and lay in broken ruins on the floor."

Audience tape missing "Thunder Road", which is the recollection of an attendee. A low generation upgrade, though still rough, was released as part of the "DS Archives Volume 9" (mjk5510).

1975-07-28 - CARTER BARRON AMPHITHEATRE, WASHINGTON, DC

INCIDENT ON 57TH STREET (7.38) / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT (3.44) / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT (6.06) / THE E STREET SHUFFLE - HAVING A PARTY (12.40) / GROWIN' UP (3.03) / IT'S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY (4.32) / SHE'S THE ONE (4.49) / FUNK SONG (7.50) / BORN TO RUN (4.21) / KITTY'S BACK (15.08) / NEW YORK CITY SERENADE (cut, 17.35) / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) (11.04) / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) (6.33) / CAROL (3.28) / A LOVE SO FINE - SHOUT (9.01)

The first of three shows at Carter Barron Amphitheatre, a 4,200-seat open-air venue located in Rock Creek Park. This show was seriously disrupted by heavy rain that delayed the start, and as a result the concert did not finish until after midnight. WHFS-FM DJ Donald “Cerphe” Colwell, who’d MC’d an in-station Springsteen performance (see listing for June 2, 1973) as well as these three shows, has commented about the infamous storm-affected show. “About an hour into his performance", said Colwell, "it began raining. This was an outdoor show and because Carter Barron is inside a National Park, everything is controlled by the U.S. Park Police. They have rules and regulations regarding shows in the rain and they wanted it stopped. Bruce paced around backstage pleading for the show to go on. The rain started and stopped three times... finally, the stage was dried off and a soaked-to-the-skin audience got the performance of their life. People who were there still e-mail or call my radio show to reminisce about that legendary, rainy night.”

Evidence strongly suggests that Cerphe's recollections are not totally accurate. Analysis of the tape, attendee recollections, and press reports indicate that the start was delayed due to torrential rainfall just as the show was about to begin, not when the show was in progress. Further rain fell just as the stage was dried off after the initial rainstorm passed, resulting in another delay before Springsteen and the band finally took to the stage at around 10-10.30pm, some two hours after the scheduled 8.30pm start time. Moisture in the air would interfere with Springsteen's guitar throughout, leading him to repeatedly apologise for delays - there was an upside to this though in an extended version of the rare 1971 instrumental "Funk Song" while he retuned his guitar. A beautiful "Incident On 57th Street" opens the set, with only Roy Bittan's piano accompanying Springsteen. Other highlights include "It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City" and an excellent (sadly cut short) "New York City Serenade". Cerphe's story that the show was stopped is accurate and can be heard on the tape. Following "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" (which includes a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection) an announcement that the show is over is made from the stage. It's hard to hear the exact words, but "it's very very very late" is clear, as is "we're sorry, but we cannot offer anymore this evening". This announcement predictably provokes a strong reaction from the crowd, which apparently refused to leave. After a time, however, Bruce and the band return to the stage for a spirited three-song, twenty-minute encore. Springsteen can be heard thanking the parks department for allowing him to continue.

Please note that the setlist above was previously listed under 1975-07-29 - as the information above suggests, the date listed on 'Talent & Feeling' is incorrect.

Audience tape available on CD 'Talent & Feeling' (CU Records). An upgraded version from a second generation reel was released to collectors in 2010. Excellent sound and atmosphere for the era - the unmistakable sound of crickets chirping can often be heard, particularly during "New York City Serenade".

1975-07-30 - CARTER BARRON AMPHITHEATRE, WASHINGTON, DC

INCIDENT ON 57TH STREET (7.23) / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT (3.45) / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT (6.07) / THE E STREET SHUFFLE - HAVING A PARTY (10.26) / IT'S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY (start cut, 4.14) / SHE'S THE ONE (4.21) / THUNDER ROAD (4.47) / BORN TO RUN (start clipped, 4.07) / UP ON THE ROOF (4.25) / KITTY'S BACK (start clipped, 18.38) / NEW YORK CITY SERENADE (start and end cut, skips, 7.28) / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) (heavily cut, 0.33) / CAROL / A LOVE SO FINE / QUARTER TO THREE

The third of three shows at Carter Barron Amphitheatre. Potentially complete setlist (although it is likely that "4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)" was played after "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)") includes what may be the first performance of The Drifters' "Up On The Roof", which Springsteen sung while sat at the lip of the stage. A beautiful arrangement with a "Thunder Road-esque" piano introduction and understated accompaniment from the band. There are only seven known performances of the song, and none after Bruce's stand at New York's Bottom Line in the middle of August 1975. The encores of "Carol", "A Love So Fine" and final song "Quarter To Three" are not included on the tape, but rather the recollections of attendees. "Thunder Road" is full band. "Incident On 57th Street" is just Roy Bittan's piano accompanying Springsteen's vocals. "Kitty's Back" includes a pronounced "Moondance" section. This tape could potentially be from the previous night, but circumstantial evidence leads us to place it here.

Audience tape of poor quality with many cuts and edits.

"Thunder Road" is full band. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection.

Incomplete setlist that includes the third of only seven known "Up On The Roof" and a very long twenty minute "Kitty's Back". "New York City Serenade" cuts short, at around ten minutes. A contributor to the Greasy Lake website recalls that "Twist And Shout" was the closing song. If accurate, this would be a tour premiere. "Thunder Road" is full band.

INCIDENT ON 57TH STREET (7.32) / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT (3.36) / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT (6.11) / THE E STREET SHUFFLE - HAVING A PARTY (12.43) / THEN SHE KISSED ME (2.50) / GROWIN' UP (3.10) / IT'S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY (5.09) / UP ON THE ROOF (4.02) / SHE'S THE ONE (4.46) / BORN TO RUN (4.07) / BACKSTREETS (6.41) / FUNK SONG (4.05) / KITTY'S BACK (19.30) / NEW YORK CITY SERENADE (17.45) / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) (11.33) / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) (6.16) / A LOVE SO FINE - HAVING A PARTY - SHOUT (10.57) / CAROL (4.26) / QUARTER TO THREE (6.23)

This is a healthy (and quite unique), 19-song performance and an important show in historical terms because it personifies the changing nature of the setlist that took shape in August as the Born To Run album neared its promotional and official release dates. First known performance of "Backstreets" and one of the last of “New York City Serenade” for the tour. It is also the last known performance of the rare instrumental “Funk Song” (previously played on July 23 and July 28). Tour premiere for "Then She Kissed Me". "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection.

Audience tape of average quality available on CDR 'Incident In Akron' as well as a superior upgraded version from a low generation tape transfer (mjk5510).

THEN SHE KISSED ME / UP ON THE ROOF

No other set details known. An article in the Beaver County Times from December 10, 1975 mentions the above two songs were performed. Singer/songwriter Joe Grushecky has mentioned in interview that this gig was the first time he'd seen Springsteen perform live, although the two were not introduced to one other until 1981.

Set includes another appearance of "Up On The Roof" (the sixth of seven known) and the tour premiere of "For You", played by Springsteen alone at the piano. "For You" does not appear on the good quality tape, but a newspaper review confirms it was in the set.

Incomplete audience tape, cutting during "New York City Serenade" and missing the encores. Released on CDR 'The Last Serenade' and upgraded in October 2013 from a low generation reel to reel source on 'There's Room Enough For Two' (JEMS).

Late (second) show: FOR YOU (start cut) / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / WHEN YOU WALK IN THE ROOM / NIGHT / GROWIN' UP / IT'S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY / THE E STREET SHUFFLE - HAVING A PARTY (start cut) / BORN TO RUN (start cut) / SHE'S THE ONE / THUNDER ROAD / KITTY'S BACK / NEW YORK CITY SERENADE / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) / QUARTER TO THREE

Two separate admission shows, 8:30pm and 11:30pm. Opening of an historic five-night (ten-show) residency at the club. Springsteen & The E Street Band had previously played a three-night (six-show) residency here in July 1974. Bottom Line co-owner Allan Pepper was offered the chance to host Bruce and the band at the club by Sam McKeith (Bruce's booking agent at William Morris) one morning by phone. Columbia Records bought a quarter of the 500 tickets available for the stand, a perfect opportunity to expose employees and journalists to the upcoming talent of Springsteen. There is no circulating audio of the early show on this opening night, but it is known that the show opened with "Thunder Road", played by Springsteen alone at the piano. The set also included only the second known performance of "Backstreets". In 2012 an audience recording of the late show finally emerged into the trading pool (fade outs between each track). The tape features the first known live performance of "Night", and the earliest known recording of "When You Walk In The Room". Opener "For You" is played by Bruce alone at the piano. "Thunder Road" is the slow version with Roy on piano and Bruce on harmonica and vocals. Both "Kitty's Back", which includes a brief snippet of Carole King's "Nothing's Too Good For My Baby", and "New York City Serenade" are extended 19+ minute renditions. This is the last recorded and confirmed performance of "New York City Serenade" until the 1999/2000 Reunion Tour when it was resurrected with a slightly more sensible running time. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection.

Late (second) show: No setlist known

Two separate admission shows, 8:30pm and 11:30pm. The second (late) show's setlist is undocumented. The first (early) show exists on a very good quality audience recording, although it's slightly marred by cuts in “She’s The One” and “Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)”. At the early show, "Thunder Road" is the slow version with Roy on piano and Bruce on harmonica and vocals. “Kitty’s Back” includes a brief excerpt of Carole King’s composition “Nothing's Too Good For My Baby”. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight" includes a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection.

The early show is available on the CDR boot 'Runaway American Dreams' (Doberman) and 'Night' (Fanatic) from Joe Kivak's master cassettes. There is no audio of the second (late) show in circulation

Two separate admission shows, 8:30pm. and 11:30pm. The setlist above has been contributed to Killing Floor by an attendee.

At the early show, "Thunder Road" is performed in the slow version with Roy on piano and Bruce on harmonica and vocals. "Rosalita Come Out Tonight" includes a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection. At the late show, "For You" is performed solo piano and "Thunder Road" is performed full band. The setlist would also include the only known 1975 performance of the rhythm and blues standard "(Get Your Kicks On) Route 66".

In an interview with forward.com, Max Weinberg recalled an event at the Bottom Line: "On August 16, 1975, we were playing a club in Greenwich Village that is not there any longer, called the Bottom Line. In those days, we played two shows a night. Our second show was going to be live on radio station WNEW-FM. Between shows I was scouting the club for a potential close, impersonal relationship. I found a smoking hot girl. I started playing to the girl. She was picking up the beat. Bruce was ready to stop but I was the only one that missed the signal to stop. He finally stopped me by taking the drumsticks out of my hand and then pretending to choke me. Needless to say, he was not in a good mood. Bruce had given everyone in the band nicknames. Mine was Mighty Max. When he introduced the band during “Rosalita,” which was broadcast live on the radio, he introduced me as the Not So Mighty Max. After the show, I knocked on his dressing room door to apologize, feeling like a third grader called to the principal. I have never taken my eyes off since. You never know what Bruce will do on stage." It's obvious that Max's recollections are not totally accurate since the live radio broadcast took place on August 15, not 16, and was of the early show, not the late as Max stated. However, the incident during the band introductions is not apparent in the radio broadcast. It may have occurred during the late show, unfortunately there is no recording in circulation.

The first (early) show was broadcast live by New York’s influential WNEW-FM, and it was a cannibalized home taping of this show off the radio that appeared on two of the first Springsteen vinyl bootlegs 'Live At The Bottom Line 8/15/75' (unknown label) and ‘Bruce Springsteen / Live’ (Coral Records), both issued in late 1975. However these boots, as well as countless permutations of the performance that came afterwards, were heavily edited, with no in-between song chatter/stories and, in some instances, tracks missing. Forty years on the best sound quality release of this show, including for the first time ever the entire broadcast without edits, can be found on the CDR 'The Way It Was - The Complete Bottom Line Broadcast', and subsequently CDs ‘The Punk Meets The Godfather' (Godfather), 'Vintage Broadcast 75' (None Listed) and CDR 'The Bottom Line On The Bottom Line' (Hot Stuff). No audio of the late (second) show circulates

Late (second) show: THE E STREET SHUFFLE / JUNGLELAND

Two separate admission shows, 8:30pm. and 11:30pm. The early show is a sixteen-song set that includes the first confirmed performance of Ike & Tina Turner's early '60s hit "It's Gonna Work Out Fine". "Thunder Road" is the slow arrangement with Roy on piano and Bruce on harmonica and vocals. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes a snippet of Isaac Hayes's "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection. There is no complete setlist known for the late show, but the two songs listed above are from an attendee recollection. Click the link above to view some of Cliff's excellent photographs from the late show.

Audience tape for the early show (Unbooted). There is no circulating audio from the second (late) show. The first (early) show previously existed only as audience tape of less that ideal quality - muddy sounding and had incomplete recordings of “Kitty’s Back”, “Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)” and “Up On The Roof”. However, the complete show is now available on various CDRs including an unbooted source and more notably on 'I Was A Thriller' (Fanatic) from the master cassettes. This version is a significant audio upgrade. Some of these tracks are on the CD 'Runaway American Dreams' (Doberman).Two excellent quality 'rogue' soundboard tracks have recently surfaced among collectors and are likely to be from one of the 1975 Bottom Line shows that have not circulated on audio in any way before. Brucebase has placed this information here, but the two tracks ("Jungleland" and "The E Street Shuffle") could be from other dates at the Bottom Line. The monologue section of “The E Street Shuffle” is noticeably edited. Both tracks are available as bonus tracks on 'The Way It Was - The Complete Bottom Line Broadcast' and "The E Street Shuffle" is also a bonus track on 'Roxy Theatre Night' (Crystal Cat).

At least one show from August 16 was filmed in colour by Barry Rebo. It is unknown how much he shot. A few seconds of "Born To Run" can be seen in Wings For Wheels, the Born To Run documentary included in the 30th Anniversary box set. In addition, the complete "Thunder Road" and "When You Walk In The Room" were shown by Thom Zimny at the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame discussion in June 2009. Springsteen's outfit visible in photographs of the late show match the short clip of "Born To Run", suggesting that the three tracks that are known to have been filmed were shot at the late show. It is possible that Rebo also shot other shows of the Bottom Line stand. In fact, Bottom Line co-owner Allan Pepper was interviewed in a 1995 issue of Backstreets magazine. In the interview Pepper says of the 1975 Bottom Line stand: "...most fans don't realize that video of those shows also exists. Bruce had the shows videotaped and he owns the tapes." Allan Pepper clearly says "shows" - this suggests that more than one show was filmed for posterity.

Two separate admission shows, 8:30pm. and 11:30pm. The 19-song setlist above has been supplied by a contributor to Killing Floor. The identity of the "instrumental" is uncertain, but it could be "A Love So Fine". At the early show, "Thunder Road" is the slow version with Roy on piano and Bruce on harmonica and vocals. "For You" is solo piano. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" features a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection. A fan remembers "We had tickets for both shows on August 17 so they let us stay between shows. We grabbed the seats right at Bruce's feet for the finale. It was the first time that I noticed that Bruce's sneakers didn't match. He sang half of "Spirit In The Night" sprawled out on our table. I remember letting a photographer come in a take a bunch of photos while leaning on me and crouching between our seats. Years later I found out how good he was when I discovered the classic photo of my wife staring up at Bruce in Hilburn's book (somewhere around page 84). Rolling Stone used it for the inside cover in the Greatest Shows of All Time issue, Hendrix at Monterrey was the cover. Several years after that another shot of Christine turned up on Legends on VH-1 as well as a great shot of my best friend and I from the early show".

The first (early) show circulates only as an audience recording, but one that seems to capture the full show - this complete audio is available on the CDR 'When You Walk In The Room’. Some of the tracks are found on the CD ‘Runaway American Dreams' (Doberman). A recent release 'Coastline To The City' on the Kivak Master Series is well worth acquiring with much improved sound quality. There is no circulating audio from the second (late) show.

1975-08-21 - ALEX COOLEY'S ELECTRIC BALLROOM, ATLANTA, GA

SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / GROWIN' UP / THE E STREET SHUFFLE / TWIST AND SHOUT

No other setlist details. Opening night of a three-night, three-show residency at this newly-opened (1974) club owned by legendary Atlanta promoter Alex Cooley. Apparently after the opening night’s show Bruce approached Cooley and, as Alex has mentioned in an interview, “he asked me if we could shut down the cash registers because they were making too much noise. That’s the only time I ever did that.” The very incomplete four song setlist above is courtesy of a review in The Great Speckled Bird, a counterculture underground newspaper based in Atlanta from 1968 to 1976. The reviewer attended two of the three shows at the Ballroom, the final night and one other - he does not state whether the four songs above are from August 21 or August 22. The show was originally scheduled for March 13, 1975 but was moved, presumably due to recording sessions.

No audio known.

1975-08-22 - ALEX COOLEY'S ELECTRIC BALLROOM, ATLANTA, GA

No setlist details. The second night of Springsteen’s three-night residency at the club. Show was originally scheduled for March 14, 1975 but was moved, presumably due to recording sessions.

No audio known.

1975-08-23 - ALEX COOLEY'S ELECTRIC BALLROOM, ATLANTA, GA

SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / DOES THIS BUS STOP AT 82ND STREET? / IT’S GONNA WORK OUT FINE / WHEN YOU WALK IN THE ROOM / GROWIN' UP / IT'S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY / THE E STREET SHUFFLE - HAVING A PARTY / SHE'S THE ONE / BORN TO RUN / THEN SHE KISSED ME / FOR YOU / KITTY’S BACK / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) / TWIST AND SHOUT

Final night of Springsteen’s three-night stint at the club. First confirmed "Does This Bus Stop At 82nd Street?" for the tour, and last known "Then She Kissed Me" until 2008. As throughout the tour, "For You" is solo piano. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection.

Soundboard tape. The above-mentioned 15-song setlist is taken from a soundboard recording of one of the three Electric Ballroom shows during this residency - the specific show has yet to be positively identified but it is now generally listed by the collector community under the final night of August 23. The tape begins with "Spirit In The Night", but in all likelihood "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out" actually opened but is missing from the circulating recording. Aside from the absent opener, the set above is probably complete. This audio has a long, somewhat disjointed collector history - nine of the tracks first appeared in the '80s on a vinyl bootleg called ‘Atlanta Georgia 1975' (no label). Years later a few more tracks from the show appeared on the CD boot 'It's Gonna Work Out Fine' (Scorpio). More recently all fifteen known songs from the show have appeared on the CD boot 'Sparks On The Ballroom' (Godfather) and in best quality on the CD 'Watch Out For The Monster Bag' from the ER Archives via JEMS, sourced from a probable second generation reel-to-reel source. However it should be noted that there have always been significant flaws in the source tape of this show available to bootleggers - both "Born To Run" and "She's The One" suffer from wobble and several other songs (“4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)”, “The E Street Shuffle”, “It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City” and “Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)”) suffer from nuisance edits and cuts. Show was originally scheduled for March 15, 1975 but was moved, presumably due to recording sessions.

1975-08-29 - UNIVERSITY CENTER PATIO, UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI, MIAMI, FL

Cancelled concert, never rescheduled. Outdoor event due to start at 8.00pm. Exact reason why the concert was cancelled is unclear, Miami University's student newspaper indicates it was a scheduling issue, with Bruce and the band planning to tour in Europe. However, this doesn't quite gel with Springsteen's touring schedule as we know it. Springsteen cancelled despite signing a contract.

1975-09-04 - THE MAIN POINT, BRYN MAWR, PA

BORN TO RUN

Prior to the resumption of the southern leg of the Born To Run tour Springsteen was giving media interviews in New York and Philadelphia to coincide with the Born To Run album release. Bruce paid a visit to the Main Point during a Jackson Browne residency. Browne was expanding on the example set by Springsteen earlier in the year (February 5) and was performing a five-night/ten-show solo benefit (starting on September 3) for the financially struggling club. Springsteen may have been present on the opening night but he definitely did not perform. However on the second night (Thursday, September 4) Bruce took the stage during Browne’s show and performed a solo acoustic rendition of “Born To Run”. There is no evidence that the sometimes noted “Thunder Road” was performed on this night or any other night during Browne’s residency. A brief report in The Villanovan student newspaper does note that Springsteen performed "a few brief numbers", so it is likely that there are other songs we don't know about. Springsteen was not present at Browne’s final show (September 7) which was simulcast on WMMR-FM and is widely circulating on boots.

1975-09-07 - YA YA LOUNGE, NEW ORLEANS, LA

No set list details known. One show - and truly unique, as the entire E Street Band give a full-length performance without Springsteen. This gig was organized by Miami Steve and advertised as The E Street Band (minus Bruce). In exchange Lee Dorsey (owner of the club) had agreed to provide guest vocals on the debut Southside Johnny album that Van Zandt was to start producing in December. Brucebase reader Wayne comments: “Miami Steve led the band to open the show singing a few '50s rock & roll songs. Then Lee Dorsey came out and they backed him on a few of his hits. During the break I remember talking to Garry Tallent and I asked him where Bruce was and he told me that Bruce had travelled on ahead to the next city”.

1975-09-09 - ELECTRIC BALLROOM, DALLAS, TX

Cancelled show, potentially rescheduled and moved to the Dallas Convention Center Theater on September 16. This date is known from a promotional radio spot that was aired on Dallas's KZEW in the weeks leading up to the scheduled date. The Electric Ballroom was a dance hall located in the industrial district of Dallas, and it seems plausible that demand led the show to be moved to the larger Theater in downtown Dallas.

1975-09-13 - MUSIC HALL, HOUSTON, TX

INCIDENT ON 57TH STREET (7.34) / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT (3.40) / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT (6.36) / PRETTY FLAMINGO (6.31) / GROWIN' UP (3.05) / IT'S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY (5.41) / THE E STREET SHUFFLE - HAVING A PARTY (23.01) / SHE'S THE ONE (4.34) / BORN TO RUN (4.15) / THUNDER ROAD (5.17) / KITTY’S BACK (cut, 17.17) / JUNGLELAND (8.51) / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) (11.01) / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) (cut, 6.17) / QUARTER TO THREE (6.39) / CAROL - LUCILLE (6.49) / TWIST AND SHOUT

Earliest known complete "Pretty Flamingo", previously it had only been used as part of other songs. Opener "Incident On 57th Street" and "Thunder Road" are slow versions with Roy on piano and Bruce on vocals and, for the latter, harmonica. "Kitty’s Back" includes some of Carole King’s composition “Nothing’s Too Good For My Baby”. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes the "Come A Little Bit Closer" introduction and a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection. The encores include an unusual medley of “Carol” and “Lucille”. NME reviewer Charles Shaar Murray writes of "Spirit In The Night": "...sitting there dangling his legs off the edge, and as he comes to the line "Ran into the lake in just his socks and his shirt", he changes "lake" to "pit" and – kthunk – right on the word "pit" he drops down into the photo pit (which doesn't actually have any photographers in it, just a coupla black cops looking totally confused). The words "in his socks and shirt" come with agonised slowness from nowhere – no-one can see him, where the hell did that sonovabitch get to? – until you see fingers clawing at the other lip of the pit and arms reach down and haul Springsteen up until he's perched, on the edge right up against the front row. He turns his head and peeks over his leather shoulder with a real sly "Heyyyyyyyyy, man" street grin, and wriggles out of the front row's clutches, drops back into the pit and hauls himself back on to the stage just as we band rampages back into the chorus with Springsteen wildly strutting back and forth across the stage."

Soundboard audio. Audio is available on the CDs ‘Music Hall' (All of Us) and ‘Thank You Houston' (Parrot). Upgraded version 'So Dark Tonight' released February 2014 from the ER Archives via JEMS. There is also twelve minutes of silent Super-8 color film footage of snippets of seven songs from this show in circulation. The seven songs featured are "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out", "Spirit In The Night", "Growin' Up", "The E Street Shuffle", "She's The One", "Born To Run", and "Kitty's Back". The film excerpts have been ‘married’ to this show’s previously circulating audio and is available on the DVD ‘Bruce Springsteen: 8MM’ (Brucevideos Productions).

The last known "A Love So Fine" until its resurrection over 20 years later for the Reunion tour, in its slight lyric/title variant "So Young And In Love". "Thunder Road" is the slow version with Roy on piano and Bruce on harmonica and vocals.

According to a fan who was there, the last track was played after the house lights came on. Bruce came back on stage with the line "Hey! Where ya going? We ain't done yet!" . No tape has ever surfaced for this show.

Bruce sings the opening lines of Lloyd Price's "Stagger Lee" as an introduction to "Spirit In The Night". "Thunder Road" is the slow version with Roy on piano and Bruce on harmonica and vocals. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes the "Come A Little Bit Closer" introduction and a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection.

Audience tape. Two recording sources circulate, a low generation source was put into circulation in August 2015 via the 'DS Archives - Volume 4' (mjk5510). This release is a huge upgrade and for the first time contains "Growin' Up", missing on all other releases. A second incomplete source of lesser quality is in circulation via the 'DS Archives - Volume 5' (mjk5510). "She's The One" is not included on any versions but the audio evidence on the newest release points to a strong possibility it was either not played at this show or was played in a different slot and missed by the taper. It has long been rumored a soundboard is in limited circulation but the circulating soundboard tape is actually the common Austin soundboard incorrectly dated.

1975-09-20 - DARBY GYMNASIUM, GRINNELL COLLEGE, GRINNELL, IA

Soundcheck: PRETTY FLAMINGO

INCIDENT ON 57TH STREET / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / IT'S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY / THUNDER ROAD / KITTY’S BACK / SHE’S THE ONE / BORN TO RUN / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) / QUARTER TO THREE

Held in the school’s 1,000-seat Darby Gymnasium, with only 200 seats available to the non-student public. There were wildfire rumors in the weeks leading up to this concert that hundreds of crazed New York and New Jersey Springsteen fanatics were planning on traveling 1,200 kilometers to sleepy Grinnell to gate crash the sold-out show. The event quickly became dubbed as 'The Springsteen Invasion' (note the pre-event promo cartoon above). Fearing trouble college officials hired a large contingent of police and security officers to keep order. It turned out to be a hoax, as no undesirables turned up and the concert went off without incident - and to overwhelming praise.

Complete setlist for this show is not known. The above-mentioned eleven songs are culled from an attendee recollection combined with titles articulated in a post concert review of the show in the student newspaper. The titles are in the correct performing order but there were four or five additional songs sandwiched among them. “Pretty Flamingo” was played at the soundcheck but not during the show. "Incident On 57th Street" is semi-solo; "Thunder Road" is the slow version with Roy on piano and Bruce on harmonica and vocals. Springsteen went into the crowd during “Spirit In The Night”. During “Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)", which featured the “Come A Little Bit Closer” intro, Bruce jumped (the student newspaper says “fell”) off the stage into the crowd. Carlson Smith, a co-organizer of the event, has told Brucebase that Springsteen’s services were procured for only $2,500, further adding “we signed the deal the previous June, just before leaving for summer vacation. It probably would have been easy for Bruce to get out of the contract, as by this time they were getting a much higher appearance fee. His management should be commended in honoring their commitment to us. When they arrived they actually seemed eager and happy to play.”

A sellout and a very rare treat for the lucky 1,800 attendees - this was a genuine “theatre-in-the round” stage set up and performance. Show features a very long “The E Street Shuffle”, the reappearance of "Backstreets" (last played during the Bottom Line stand in August), and Manfred Mann's "Pretty Flamingo". Bruce sings the opening lines of Lloyd Price's "Stagger Lee" as an introduction to "Spirit In The Night". "Thunder Road" is the slow version with Roy on piano and Bruce on harmonica and vocals.

Audience tape available as 'Minneapolis Shuffle', but unfortunately of not great quality and featuring numerous edits. In July 2015, a new transfer of improved quality from a second generation tape was released via the DS Archives - Volume 2 (mjk5510).

Held in the school’s Hill Auditorium. Bruce’s 26th birthday and he delivers an extra special performance, among the best on the Born To Run Tour. Unfortunately the circulating audio ("Ann Arbor 1975") doesn’t do the show justice. "Thunder Road" is the opening song in the slow arrangement featuring Roy on piano and Bruce on harmonica and vocals, the introduction to "Spirit In The Night" includes the opening lines of Lloyd Price's 1958 hit "Stagger Lee", "Kitty's Back" contains a snippet of "Nothing's Too Good For My Baby", "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" starts off with "Come A Little Bit Closer" and includes a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection, "Quarter To Three" is played, stopped, started up again, stopped and started up again a final time, and the first known "Detroit Medley" contains a short piano solo by Roy during "Jenny Take A Ride", includes "Back In The U.S.A." and does not return to "Devil With The Blue Dress" before it ends. Click the link above to read an interesting review of the show from The Michigan Daily, which includes the final sentence "...another step towards the day when the name Bruce Springsteen will become a household word."

One of the first known versions of "Meeting Across The River" to be played. "Spirit In The Night" includes the opening lines of Lloyd Price's "Stagger Lee" as an introduction. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes the "Come A Little Bit Closer" introduction and a snippet from "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection.

Soundboard tape (Sciaky) released on 'Iowa Shuffle' (ROC ROC). Also available on CD 'Live Songs' (Supersonic). In 2007 the soundboard tapes formerly owned by Ed Sciaky have circulated representing the best available quality to date. Held in the school’s Hancher Auditorium. "Jungleland" seems to be missing on circulating tapes, but the first few bars of the track can be heard before the tape cuts to "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)". Released on CD 'Meeting Across The River' (Piggham), which has a fair amount of "Jungleland" on it.

MEETING ACROSS THE RIVER / IT'S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY / BACKSTREETS / KITTY'S BACK

No other set details known. An attendee recalls that "Meeting Across The River" opened the show, and "Backstreets" was also performed. The concert was originally scheduled to be held on September 19 at the Milo Bail Student Center at the University of Nebraska, but due to demand was moved to the Music Hall venue attached to the Civic Auditorium in downtown Omaha. Tickets for university students were $3.00 and paid attendance was 1,645. A newspaper review of the show also mentions that "It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City" and "Kitty's Back" were played - the article goes into some detail about the concert, click the link above to read it. At this point in 1975 the hype machine had really started to build momentum, just a month before the Time / Newsweek covers. Jim Recalls: "Bruce was heckled by audience members perhaps not convinced that Springsteen deserved the hype, but by the end of the show he had won the crowd over".

Just 45 minutes into the concert a bomb threat is phoned in to the theatre, and the night's MC Bob Reitman (disc jockey for WQFM) is forced to enter the stage after "Thunder Road" (which is the slow version featuring Roy on piano and Bruce on harmonica and vocals) to inform the crowd of the threat, asking them to return in three hours time. The police search the theatre and find no bomb, so the band return at midnight for another two hours on stage. Bruce and the boys passed the time during the delay in a nearby bar (according to Bruce, the Pfister Hotel in downtown Milwaukee) and as the show gets back underway it's evident that Bruce has had a few drinks - repeatedly and hilariously asking the audience "are you loose?!" during an outrageous "Little Queenie" (the first circulating version of this song with the E Street Band - click the link above to hear it). There is also an exceptionally long rendition of "The E Street Shuffle" that includes a 14-minute introduction. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes the "Come A Little Bit Closer" intro and a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection. Click the link above to read a pair of news articles with a little more detail about the events.

1975-10-04 - MICHIGAN PALACE, DETROIT, MI

TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT (4.02) / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT (7.07) / IT'S GONNA WORK OUT FINE (7.17) / SHE'S THE ONE (4.51) / BORN TO RUN (4.31) / THE E STREET SHUFFLE - HAVING A PARTY (13.58) / BACKSTREETS (5.24) / KITTY'S BACK (19.13) / JUNGLELAND (10.08) / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) (cut, 10.55) / DETROIT MEDLEY (5.17) / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) (7.39) / AIN'T TOO PROUD TO BEG (3.26) / QUARTER TO THREE (7.55) / LITTLE QUEENIE (8.58) / TWIST AND SHOUT (7:10)

Set opens with "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out" and includes an exceptional encore with a very spirited "Detroit Medley", the first rendition of The Temptations' "Ain't Too Proud To Beg" (sung as a duet with Miami Steve) and the second of three tour performances of "Little Queenie". "Spirit In The Night" includes the opening lines of Lloyd Price's "Stagger Lee" as an introduction. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection. Bruce would later comment that this night was the first time in his life that he did not want to get up on stage. In an interview with Robert Hilburn for the Los Angeles Times, Bruce felt that the promotion for Born To Run was overwhelming him. "I felt that I had lost a certain control of myself", he told Hilburn, "There was all the publicity and all the backlash. I felt that the thing I wanted most in my life - my music - being swept away and I didn't know if I could do anything about it. I could see how people get into drinking or drugs, because the one thing you want at a time like that is to be distracted - in a big way I was lucky. I had my band, which was people I had grown up with." As a side note, this story has occasionally been incorrectly attributed to Bruce's February 15, 1977 show in Detroit, particularly in Rob Kirkpatrick's Magic in the Night: The Words and Music of Bruce Springsteen. However, Hilburn's original article is clearly referring to this show. A critical ear could perhaps detect a slight drop in the energy of Springsteen's performance compared to other shows around this time, although the encore is one of the best of the tour to date. It's interesting that Bruce chose to open with the upbeat "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out", instead of the usual "Meeting Across The River", "Thunder Road" or "Incident On 57th Street", all played in slow, downbeat arrangements.

Soundboard and audience recordings. The soundboard recording is available on the CD releases 'First Night in Detroit' (Midnight Beat) and 'Walk Like The Heroes' (Anubis), both releases have pitch issues throughout. A very good audience recording surfaced in October 2015 from a first generation tape and is available via the 'DS Archives Volume 7' (mjk5510). An upgraded low generation reel source of the soundboard tape was recently released as part of the 'ER Archives Volume 13' (JEMS). This new version is pitch corrected and "Backstreets" has been patched with the recently discovered audience source but the end of "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" remains cut.

1975-10-10 - MONMOUTH ARTS CENTER, RED BANK, NJ

Cancelled show (before any advertising took place or tickets sold), rescheduled to the following night. The original intention was to play single show gigs on October 10 and 11. This was then changed to a two-show booking on October 11.

1975-10-11 - MONMOUTH ARTS CENTER, RED BANK, NJ

Early (first) show: MEETING ACROSS THE RIVER / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / BORN TO RUN / PRETTY FLAMINGO / NIGHT / KITTY'S BACK / THUNDER ROAD / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY)

Late (second) show: INCIDENT ON 57TH STREET (5.26) / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT (3.32) / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT (7.18) / IT’S GONNA WORK OUT FINE (6.34) / SHE'S THE ONE (5.31) / BORN TO RUN (4.03) / THE E STREET SHUFFLE (18.26) / BACKSTREETS (6.22) / KITTY'S BACK (17.33) / JUNGLELAND (9.05) / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) (9.46) / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) (6.13) / QUARTER TO THREE (6.42) / CAROL (with David Sancious) (6.12) / DETROIT MEDLEY (5.35)

Two separate admission shows (8:30pm and 12:00am), with Springsteen & The E Street Band the sole act on the bill and the building marquee proclaiming 'The Homecoming'. As is so often the case with Bruce’s pre-1976 gigs, the fact that there were two shows on the same night has caused its fair share of confusion through the years. The partial setlist from the early show listed above is from post-concert reports and from a fan present who also recalls that most of the photos in the Newsweek articles came from these shows. "Thunder Road" is the slow version with Roy on piano and Bruce on harmonica and vocals. David Sancious guests on piano during "Carol". The introduction to "Spirit In The Night" includes the opening lines from Lloyd Price's 1958 #1 hit "Stagger Lee". "The E Street Shuffle" is the slow version but, unusually, does not include "Having A Party". As he did at several shows during this part of the tour, Bruce incorporates a small snatch of Jay & The American’s hit “Come A Little Bit Closer” into the start of “Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)”, before which Roy plays a few snippets including a bit of "The Godfather Love Theme"; the song also includes a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection.

There is no audio from the early show in circulation. The 15-song late show setlist is taken from a long-circulating audience recording of good (but not very good) quality and represents the complete show. An incomplete eight-song soundboard of this late show first surfaced on a CDR title called 'Last Homecoming Before The Hype'. In 1996 a complete soundboard of the late show was released on the CD 'The Homecoming' (E ST.). One or both of the "Homecoming" shows was filmed in black and white by Barry Rebo. Footage can be seen in Wings For Wheels, the documentary on the making of Born To Run, and in The Promise, the Darkness On The Edge Of Town documentary. In addition, "Kitty's Back" was in the archive reel footage at the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame exhibition in Cleveland and also shown to the public at "An Evening With Thom Zimny" at Monmouth University on September 23, 2014, along with footage of Danny Federici vamping on accordion during a soundcheck performance of "4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)". It has been confirmed by comparing audio recordings that this film of "Kitty's Back" is from the early show. However, it remains a possibility that the film of "Jungleland" that can be seen on Wings For Wheels may be from the late show.

1975-10-16 - THE ROXY THEATRE, WEST HOLLYWOOD, CA

THUNDER ROAD / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / PRETTY FLAMINGO / SHE’S THE ONE / BORN TO RUN / BACKSTREETS / KITTY'S BACK / JUNGLELAND / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) / GOIN’ BACK / DETROIT MEDLEY

This was the opening of a four-night (six-show) residency at the club. This first night was a single show and, unknown to Bruce, Colombia Records had reserved many of the seats for media and industry people - a situation that Springsteen gradually became aware of during the show (by the lack of the usual audience enthusiasm) and one that he was very miffed about after the show and then mentioned to the audience at the following night’s shows. The above-noted setlist, culled from assorted (glowing) media reviews of the show, is believed to be missing two or three songs. "Thunder Road" is the slow version with Roy on piano and Bruce on harmonica and vocals. Songwriter Carole King was present at this show and Springsteen premiered and dedicated a heartfelt rendition of her 1966 song “Goin' Back” to her. Other luminaries present include Jack Nicholson, Peter Boyle, Robert de Niro, Jackson Browne, Jim Messina and Neil Diamond. It may have been at this show that de Niro heard Springsteen's "you talkin' to me?" schtick that he later famously improvised in Taxi Driver. In October 2007 Springsteen dedicated "Meeting Across The River" to Peter Boyle on what would have been his 72nd birthday (he died in December 2006), saying that they met for the first time in New York City.

A fan present at all the shows remembers "I believe it was a Columbia Records event that certainly included people from Billboard as well as anyone in the music press that would come. LA was pretty cool to Bruce before these shows and Columbia was pushing hard to get the industry folks to see him. Bruce certainly had no cult following on the West Coast, as we didn't see any of the same people up at the front of the stage from show to show. After the single show on Sunday night, my wife and I were at an IHOP on Hollywood Blvd. for a really early breakfast, when who comes in but Bruce, Mike Appel and their ladies. Bruce looked at us, laughed and said something like "I can't shake you guys". We let him eat his pancakes in peace. The next day, we bumped into the rest of the band at Disneyland! No one else seemed to have a clue who they were!"

No circulating audio.

1975-10-17 - THE ROXY THEATRE, WEST HOLLYWOOD, CA

Early (first) show: THUNDER ROAD (5.30) / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT (3.44) / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT (6.43) / PRETTY FLAMINGO (10.57) / SHE'S THE ONE (5.31) / BORN TO RUN (4.04) / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) (7.32) / BACKSTREETS (6.40) / KITTY'S BACK (18.18) / JUNGLELAND (9.04) / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) (9.51) / GOIN' BACK (5.04) / DETROIT MEDLEY (6.17)

Two separate admission shows. "Thunder Road" is the slow version with Roy on piano and Bruce on harmonica and vocals at both shows. At the early show, Bruce sings the opening of "Stagger Lee" as an introduction to "Spirit In The Night". "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection at both shows.

The first (early) show was broadcast live on KWEST-FM, the audio of which is available on boot CDs 'Backstreets' (Chapter One), ‘Ain't Nobody Here From Billboard Tonight' (Moonlight), ‘The Roxy Road’ (Dynamite Studio), ‘Down In Roxyland' (Z005) and in improved quality as 'Roxy Theatre Night' (Crystal Cat). An audience recording of the late show is available from CB's aka: Mr Anonymous master cassettes which runs slightly slow (Fanatic) as well as a more recent upgraded pitch adjusted transfer from the master cassettes titled 'Watch Me Now' via JEMS. The two-LP 'There Ain't Nobody Here From Billboard Tonight' (HAR) was one of the very first vinyl bootlegs, issued in late October 1975, just a few weeks after the show took place. This release was repressed many times by various labels and under different titles.

1975-10-18 - THE ROXY THEATRE, WEST HOLLYWOOD, CA

Early (first) show: THUNDER ROAD / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / THE E STREET SHUFFLE - HAVING A PARTY / WHEN YOU WALK IN THE ROOM / SHE’S THE ONE / BORN TO RUN / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) / BACKSTREETS / KITTY’S BACK / JUNGLELAND / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / GOIN’ BACK / CAROL

Late (second) show: THUNDER ROAD / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / PRETTY FLAMINGO / WHEN YOU WALK IN THE ROOM / SHE’S THE ONE / BORN TO RUN / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) / BACKSTREETS / KITTY’S BACK / JUNGLELAND / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / GOIN’ BACK / DETROIT MEDLEY / QUARTER TO THREE

Two separate admission shows. At both shows, "Thunder Road" is performed in the slow version with Roy on piano and Bruce on harmonica and vocals, and "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection. At the late show, "Spirit In The Night" features the "Stagger Lee" introduction.

An audience recording of the early show circulates on CDR (Unbooted) and also on 'Goin' Back To 1975 - The Lost Show' (Fanatic), which is a transfer from the master cassettes. The late show also circulates on an audience tape (Unbooted) that is missing "Jungleland". In 2016 JEMS released an upgraded, pitch-adjusted version of both shows transferred from CB's master tapes titled 'Hit Me With A Double Shot' (featuring the complete late show). The first (early) show was also professionally audio recorded by Springsteen’s team, however only "Thunder Road" has ever surfaced - officially issued by CBS on the 1986 Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band / Live 1975-85 boxed set. It has long been rumored that director Arnold Levine (who had previously filmed Bruce’s May 1, 1973 Los Angeles concert) filmed one or both of these October 18 shows, although none of this alleged Roxy footage has ever surfaced. Interestingly semi-pro filmmaker (and Springsteen friend) Barry Rebo also confirmed in a 2005 interview that he filmed Springsteen during this Roxy residency, although Rebo gave no specific details.

Final show of the four-night (six-show) residency at the club. This final night was only a single show. "Thunder Road" is the slow version with Roy on piano and Bruce on harmonica and vocals. Bruce sings the opening lines to "Stagger Lee" as an introduction to "Spirit In The Night". "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection. A Brucebase reader who attended comments: "The October 19 show was clearly the high point of Bruce's four night stand. It features far and away the best "The E Street Shuffle" I've ever experienced. He got the crowd singing along and just played it from there. It's right up there with some of the moments during the (early 1975) Westbury show”. During "Spirit In The Night" Bruce steps out into the audience. Someone close shouts "over here!" to Bruce several times, where Bruce's reply is "you're on the wrong side".

Audio circulates as an audience recording, 'Last Night At The Roxy' (Racing In The Street) and 'Yes, We're Talkin To You' (Fanatic) of reasonable quality, if not somewhat marred by audio cuts in "Born To Run", "Kitty's Back", and "Goin' Back". In 2016 JEMS released an upgraded, pitch adjusted version of this recording titled 'On The Mean Streets Of Hollywood'.

1975-10-23 - GERDE’S FOLK CITY, NEW YORK CITY, NY

HAPPY BIRTHDAY

With a five-day break in the West Coast leg of the tour, Bruce flies to New York to attend a surprise, 61st birthday party for Gerde’s Folk City owner Mike Porco (who hired Bob Dylan for his first New York club gigs in 1961). Dylan turned up with a film crew as well as Joan Baez and other members of his soon-to-tour Rolling Thunder Revue. This was the first time Springsteen and Dylan had met and both formed part of a communal group that performed a filmed rendition of “Happy Birthday” to Porco. Brief audio-video excerpts of this event are seen in Dylan’s 1978 movie “Renaldo & Clara”, though no footage of Springsteen is seen - the “Happy Birthday” segment remains in the vaults. Allegedly it was at this party the Dylan invited Springsteen to join the Rolling Thunder Revue, with Bruce allegedly turning the offer down due to his own tour commitments coupled with the fact that he wouldn’t be able to use the E Street Band for his guest spots in Dylan’s show.

1975-10-25 - PARAMOUNT THEATRE, PORTLAND, OR

No set details known. Bruce’s first-ever appearance in Portland but a somewhat disappointing turnout nevertheless - about 30% of the tickets remained unsold. According to a Portland journalist who attended most of the balcony area was empty.

BACKSTREETS / KITTY'S BACK / JUNGLELAND / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / DETROIT MEDLEY / FOR YOU / QUARTER TO THREE / CAROL / TWIST AND SHOUT

This Seattle gig was a sellout, unlike the previous night’s weak attendance in Portland. Bruce can be heard thanking the crowd and mentioning this is his first-ever concert in Seattle (a scheduled appearance in early March 1973 had been cancelled). "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection. "For You" is solo piano.

Partial setlist (above) is known from a circulating audience tape.

1975-10-29 - SACRAMENTO MEMORIAL AUDITORIUM, SACRAMENTO, CA

THUNDER ROAD

No other set details known. There were only a couple of poor turnouts during the entire 1975 leg of the Born To Run tour - and this was one of them. Although Springsteen had by this point made a solid impact in the major cities along the west coast, he was still not well known in regional areas. The following day's Sacramento Union newspaper reported only 600 of the venue's 2,500 tickets were sold.

Jonathan's recollections: "In October 1975 I was stationed at Travis Air Force Base In Fairfield, California about 45 minutes down the road (Route 80) from Sacramento. Bruce had just made the cover of Time. Unexpectedly my flight mission overseas had been cancelled and I talked my then wife (who knew nothing of Bruce) into going to see Springsteen. We arrived just before show time and figured we would have to buy tickets from scalpers if we could even get in. I was stunned to be able to buy third row floor seats at the auditorium kiosk. The reports said 600 tickets sold but I don't believe there were even 500 people actually there. (Ironically we came back the next week to see Fleetwood Mac and the place was all but sold out). Springsteen came out and spoke to the crowd. Springsteen said he would give us the same show as if the place were sold out. For the opening he sat on a metal chair and did a solo slow acoustic version of "Thunder Road". By my watch he played from about 7:40 until 12:15 AM. I don't remember the set list except he seemed to play extended versions of most of the album tunes and a couple I did not recognize. My wife was blown away not believing that one person could play that long."

No other set details known. Produced by Bill Graham, who acted as the evening's MC. At two-and-a-half hours one of the longest shows of the entire 1975-76 Born To Run Tour, courtesy of an extended, six-song encore section. Following the third encore Bill Graham came out and told the crowd the show was over. Seeing the roadies beginning to tear down, most of the crowd filed out. However after half the crowd had left the auditorium they heard wild cheering erupting back inside the hall and immediately turned around and went back - Bruce and the band were plugging in for more. Partial setlist above courtesy of the recollections of Jack Bogdanski - click the link above for a few photos from the show taken by Jack. The show got a none too complimentary review in the San Francisco Chronicle, although the reporter only managed to stay for the first twenty minutes. Reviews in the Stanford Daily and Los Medanos College's Experience were more positive, and add a few more songs to give us the very incomplete setlist above. The reviewer in the Experience refers to "a smouldering version of an old twisting song"; this is probably "Quarter To Three". "For You" is solo piano. The final encore include an unusual placing for "Meeting Across The River", and the final song, "Carol". Please get in touch if you can help us with the setlist.

It is understood that Bill Graham presented Bruce and the band with special T-shirts to celebrate both the sold-out concert and Springsteen's appearance on the front covers of Time and Newsweek. Fifty shirts depicting the cover of Time on the front and Newsweek on the back were delivered to the dressing room at the Paramount Theatre and handed out to the band and crew. One of these shirts appeared on an auction site in 2012.

Audience tape, incomplete, missing the last four tracks, last two minutes of "Kitty's Back" has major pitch issues. Available on CDR 'That Thunder In Your Heart'. In September 2015 a 2nd Generation tape transfer was put into circulation via the DS Archives Volume 6 (mjk5510). This version is a big upgrade with the final two minutes of "Kitty's Back" pitch adjusted.

THUNDER ROAD / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / PRETTY FLAMINGO / SHE'S THE ONE / BORN TO RUN / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) / IT'S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY / BACKSTREETS / KITTY'S BACK / JUNGLELAND / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / DETROIT MEDLEY / TWIST AND SHOUT

Held in the school’s Gammage Auditorium. One of the more memorable - and best - shows of the Born To Run Tour. There were phoned-in bomb threats received several hours before the start of this show - however, after some initial panic by organizers and the Springsteen camp, the police determined that the individuals making the threats had gotten their schedules mixed up - they’d been intended for controversial ex-Vietnam veteran Lieutenant William Calley’s speaking engagement in Gammage the previous night! Springsteen delivered a blistering show and worked the crowd into a complete frenzy, so much so that the large, humanity-packed balcony of Gammage began visibly swaying during the final stages of the concert. It was later reported that school officials had nearly decided to stop the show prematurely, although a post-concert engineering report gave the balcony a clean bill of health. Bruce refers to this incident when he returns to the same venue in 1996: "It's nice to be back at the Gammage... I seem to remember wrecking this place as a young man... yeah, something about the balcony, I don´t know... I´m sure they got it all fixed by now, fortunately..." He went on to suggest that those seated on the balcony refrain from too much dancing. "Thunder Road" is the slow version with Roy on piano and Bruce on harmonica and vocals. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection.

After a cancellation and a couple of “almost-but-not quite” bookings in 1973, this Tampa gig turned out to be Springsteen’s first-ever performance in Florida (and Bruce can be heard acknowledging such to the audience). This show had originally been planned for November 9, but was bumped back a day, probably due to the West Coast itinerary. A sellout, with additional standing room only seats sold that day. "Thunder Road" is the slow version with Roy on piano and Bruce on harmonica and vocals. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection. See the articles linked above.

The above-mentioned setlist is taken from a circulating audience recording of good quality and represents the complete show. Available on CD 'Running Dry' (Party Line) and on CDRs 'And Jack Knife Cried' and '1001 American Nights' (Anubis).

1975-11-11 - JAI ALAI FRONTON, MIAMI, FL

THUNDER ROAD / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT / THE E STREET SHUFFLE / SHE'S THE ONE / BORN TO RUN / NIGHT / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) / BACKSTREETS / KITTY'S BACK / JUNGLELAND / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / FOR YOU / CAROL / DETROIT MEDLEY / QUARTER TO THREE

Similar to the previous night show in Tampa but with "For You" and "Carol" included in the set. An article in the November 13 Palm Beach Post says that the show started an hour late due to a truck delivering the piano breaking down. However, the Miami News says the delay was due to an out-of-tune piano. Whatever the reason Bruce wasn't affected, playing for two hours and 40 minutes with three encores. A detailed review in The Hurricane (student newspaper of the University Of Miami) culminates in the incomplete setlist above. The review says that the setlist includes every song from Born To Run apart from "Meeting Across The River", as well as a unidentified 1950s rock & roll number when Springsteen's guitar shorts out. The set also includes a slow "The E Street Shuffle", along with a solo piano "For You". "Thunder Road" is the slow version with Roy on piano and Bruce on harmonica and vocals.

Circulating audio linked to this show is actually from the previous night’s gig in Tampa. This audio sometimes circulates as a straight duplication, other times with one or two tracks re-sequenced and with alternate between song editing. There is no circulating audio from this show. Disappointing turnout - about 30% of the seats remained unsold. The show was rescheduled several times - first arranged for October 14, then November 14, before finally ending up on November 11.

1975-11-13 - NEW HAVEN VETERANS MEMORIAL COLISEUM, NEW HAVEN, CT

Springsteen (accompanied by girlfriend Karen Darvin) attends Bob Dylan’s Rolling Thunder Revue gig (which included Joni Mitchell’s debut in the troupe). The Rolling Thunder Tour had begun on October 31. Also attending (like Bruce, as viewers only) were Patti Smith and John Prine. Dylan’s film crew was present and shooting backstage, but no footage of Springsteen has ever surfaced.

1975-11-18 - HAMMERSMITH ODEON, LONDON, ENGLAND

THUNDER ROAD (5.24) / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT (3.54) / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT (7.27) / LOST IN THE FLOOD (6.14) / SHE'S THE ONE (5.24) / BORN TO RUN (4.18) / THE E STREET SHUFFLE - HAVING A PARTY (12.40) / IT'S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY (5.23) / BACKSTREETS (7.43) / KITTY'S BACK (17.11) / JUNGLELAND (9.46) / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) (9.16) / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) (6.52) / DETROIT MEDLEY (6.46) / FOR YOU (start slightly cut, 8.18) / QUARTER TO THREE (6.06)

Bruce's first ever appearance in Europe. An audience tape confirmed tour performance of "Lost In The Flood", last played in October 1974. However, the number of incomplete / unknown setlists around October and November 1975 mean it may not be the first time the song was actually performed. "Thunder Road" is the slow version with Roy on piano and Bruce on harmonica and vocals. The introduction to "Spirit In The Night" includes the opening lines from Lloyd Price's "Stagger Lee", although the official release credits them to Ahlert and Leslie's "The Moon Was Yellow (And The Night Was Young)", apparently mistakenly. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes the "Come A Little Bit Closer" introduction and a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection. "For You" is solo piano. Bruce's first show outside North America was turbulent. Before the show Springsteen tore "Finally London is ready for Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band" promotional posters from the walls - furious with the hype and publicity. The controversy clearly affected the performance as the DVD shows a somewhat sombre Springsteen, not the usual livewire. His mood is perhaps most evident in the introduction to "The E Street Shuffle". Normally a rambling tale, Bruce tails off after just a few sentences, going straight into the song. The show is still intense however, with outstanding versions of "Lost In The Flood" and "It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City", amongst others.

Audience tape, soundboard (good quality but all the between song chat is cut so lacks atmosphere somewhat) and official CD/DVD release. Just days before the concert Mike Appel asked Old Grey Whistle Test producer Mike Appleton to film the show. Appleton recorded the concert with a BBC film crew. The initial plan was to use the footage for a television special, but the result was simply too dark. The first public sighting of this footage was a clip of "4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)" in the 1987 BBC Glory Days documentary. Eleven years later "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" was used in another BBC documentary, A Secret History, which was first broadcast in 1998 to promote the Tracks boxset. Soon after, an hour of mostly incomplete songs leaked into collectors' circles, including outstanding single camera black and white footage of "It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City". The Born To Run 30th Anniversary Edition box set released in 2005 includes the complete show on DVD, restored from thirty-two reels of silent 16mm film and matched with multi-track audio. The reconstruction was painstaking, taking editor Thom Zimny over a year to complete. Subsequent to the box set, the audio was also released separately, on a two-CD set. Monty Python's Michael Palin was present at the show, and wrote about it extensively in his diaries. It is also known that this show was initially going to be broadcast over the radio (either live or delayed) but Mike Appel backed out at the last minute (the day of the show) as he felt that Bruce's mood at the time would not lead to a particularly good show.

Bruce's first ever appearance in Sweden. "Thunder Road" is the slow version with Roy on piano and Bruce on harmonica and vocals. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection. A fan present is certain that the last song performed was "For You", but a Finnish newspaper review from 1975 (from music magazine Soundi) says last three tracks are as shown above.

Audience tape (incomplete), released on CDR 'Stoccolma 75'. The tape cuts during "Detroit Medley", and does not include the final two songs listed above.

Bruce's triumphant return to London is a completely different affair to his November 18 concert, an excellent performance with several extra encores including first tour appearance of Elvis's "Wear My Ring Around Your Neck". European debuts of "Growin' Up", "Pretty Flamingo", "Sha-La-La", "Wear My Ring Around Your Neck", "When You Walk In The Room", "Twist And Shout", and "Little Queenie", and first ever performance in England of "Carol". Third and final "Little Queenie" for the tour, not to be played again until 1999 in Philadelphia. "Thunder Road" is the slow version with Roy on piano and Bruce on harmonica and vocals. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection. "For You" is solo piano.

Soundboard and audience tape. The soundboard is missing "Thunder Road" and "It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City". This show was not filmed and the "4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)" cut previously listed as being from this show and shown on the BBC documentary Glory Days is from the show on November 18. The soundboard recording is on CD releases 'Shit Hot And Rockin'' & 'London Calling', with the two missing tracks (see above) replaced with an audience recording. A recent auction piece (2002) confirms that the tapes, at least in part were made officially by Laurel Canyon with two reels surfacing containing "Thunder Road", "Lost In The Flood", "Growin’ Up", "Sha-La-La", "4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)", Detroit Medley" and "Walk In The Room". It is assumed that the tracks all come from this show. Another set of Record plant tape reels labelled 'England' and bearing the date 02-13-76 are also known - again it is assumed these are from this show and are soundboard recordings. Also available on CDR from Ed Sciaky's tapes in upgraded audio quality, however "Thunder Road" and "It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City" are still missing.

"Thunder Road" is the slow version with Roy on piano and Bruce on harmonica and vocals. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes the "Come A Little Bit Closer" introduction and a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection.

Audience tape (Unbooted). Two recording sources circulate, available in excellent quality from Steve Hopkins' master tapes. A second source recorded in the balcony also circulates. Available on CDRs 'Boston 75' and upgraded from Steve Hopkins' masters titled 'Close Encounter'. This version features none of the cuts present in the previously circulating sources. Steve Hopkins' recording notes explains the choice of title: "You'll hear some crowd commotion during the slow final verse of "Spirit In The Night" ('Hazy Davy got really hurt…'). Here's what happened. I was recording from the second row center with my deck in a briefcase under my seat and holding the mic at head level, as high as possible without being obvious. As the song slows, the lights go down and Bruce jumps down from the stage into the orchestra pit and out of sight. There's seating there now, but in 1975 there was an actual 'pit' between the stage and the audience. As the song continues, he peers up over the edge of the pit, locks eyes with the girl sitting next to me, continues singing and approaches her, climbs over the people in the front row and sits down in her lap, now singing directly to her. Then he proceeds to sprawl out, completely flat on his back, spread across four of us in that row, so that his head is actually in my lap, his mic and my mic are no more than a foot or two apart as he continues singing. All this time, the spot light is following him and on us, so I've lowered my mic under my seat, out of sight, but still recording, thinking security would be on me at any minute. And then, as quickly as it happened, he was gone and bounded back onto the stage to finish the song."

No full details known. Fan present at this show reports that "He played many of the songs listed from the nights before, including "Born to Run", "Thunder Road", and "Kitty's Back", but it was a few weeks before Christmas and he also played "Santa Claus is Comin' To Town". I was not aware that he ever played that and I remember the crowd going absolutely crazy". "Thunder Road" is almost certainly the slow version with Roy on piano and Bruce on harmonica and vocals.

A then-member of the school’s concert committee has told Brucebase: “We were incredibly lucky. We signed the contract with Springsteen’s management in early September, just as his new album hit the shops, but before it climbed in the charts, we got him for just a couple of grand, but if we’d waited a few weeks the price would have been maybe 10 times that and way out of our budget range. The old Davis Gym had a 2,200 capacity but the way Springsteen’s crew demanded the set-up meant we only had about 1,800 tickets available. We did all this pre-promotion that ended up being totally unnecessary. It was the first time I ever witnessed scalping. It was a massive night around campus - pre and post concert parties everywhere. The buzz lasted for a week”. The above-mentioned partial setlist (it’s missing two or three songs) is from the recollection of Brucebase reader (and show attendee) Keith, who also noted that “Meeting Across The River” may have been performed. "Thunder Road" is the slow version with Roy on piano and Bruce on harmonica and vocals.

No circulating audio.

THUNDER ROAD (4.58) / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT (3.26) / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT (6.00) / LOST IN THE FLOOD (5.59) / SHE'S THE ONE (5.20) / BORN TO RUN (3.50) / IT'S MY LIFE (4.46) / IT'S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY (edited, 3.21) / BACKSTREETS (7.03) / KITTY'S BACK (16.43) / JUNGLELAND (8.35) / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) (10.44) / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) (6.28) / SANTA CLAUS IS COMIN' TO TOWN (4.14) / DETROIT MEDLEY (7.44) / FOR YOU (8.02) / SHA-LA-LA (2.38) / QUARTER TO THREE (6.18)

First known version of The Animals' "It's My Life". In the 1987 BBC documentary Glory Days, Max Weinberg spoke about the premiere of "It's My Life" when he was asked if Bruce had ever launched into a song without telling the band what he was going to play. Max said that the band had never rehearsed the song before playing it in concert, but fortunately they all knew it. This is the concert that the official "Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town" was recorded at, and the resulting recording is now on heavy rotation on radio every Christmas. In fact, the entire show was professionally recorded (along with several other shows in December) under the guidance of Jimmy Iovine as part of a plan to release a live album. "Thunder Road" is the slow version with Roy on piano and Bruce on harmonica and vocals. Danny and Roy play a polka on accordion before "4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)". Great show. Note to collectors - some tapes circulate with "4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)" missing. The show started late due to weather conditions - heavy snow resulted in heavy traffic on Long Island. The 'Roy Rogers' that Bruce mentions in the introduction to "She's The One" is (was) a fast food hamburger joint down the road from the College. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes a snippet from "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection, as well as Roy playing a snippet of "Hernando's Hideaway". "For You" is solo piano.

Soundcheck available from an audience tape (Unbooted). Audience tape of the concert available on CDRs (Unbooted) and 'It's My Life' (Fanatic), which is a transfer from the master cassettes. A Brucebase reader says he met Ed Sciaky after the show, who told him that "Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town" had been recorded for the radio.

Held in the sold-out 3,500-seat Laker Hall. Following Springsteen’s simultaneous Time and Newsweek cover stories the demand from northeastern U.S. Colleges and Universities to procure Bruce’s services increased significantly. In a hotly contested bidding war State University of New York beat out rival Syracuse University for the right to hold this concert. According to newspaper coverage (click the link above to read) Springsteen received $15,000 for his night's work. "Thunder Road" is the slow version with Roy on piano and Bruce on harmonica and vocals. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes a snippet from "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection. "For You" is solo piano.

Audience tape, two recording sources circulate. The first was released on 'Pretty Oswego' and a second low gen source was released as 'Prettier Oswego' (ER Archives Volume 2 via JEMS) and is a substantial upgrade.

Despite newspaper reports to the contrary, the show does not feature a unique performance of "Here Comes Santa Claus", a cover of the early 60s Bob B. Soxx & The Blue Jeans / Phil Spector-produced hit; instead the tape confirms the expected performance of "Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town." This song was immediately followed by Santa making a surprise appearance onstage, clowning around with Bruce, and handing out toy instruments as gifts to the band. "Thunder Road" is the slow version with Roy on piano and Bruce on harmonica and vocals. During "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)", which includes a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection, Bruce changes the lyrics to "I want to Kung-Fu ya, sock it to ya, I wanna be your man." "For You" is solo piano.

Audience tape, which entered circulation in 2012 via JEMS and the ER Archives. "Quarter to Three" is the presumed show closer, but not present on the tape.

Previous information suggested that there was a delay to the start of the show, but it is now understood that the show began on time with Bruce playing "Thunder Road" accompanied only by Roy Bittan, and continued as normal with the rest of the band taking the stage for "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out". The 17-song set above represents the complete show, and is supplied by Dave. "Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town" includes Clarence receiving a toy saxophone, and Bruce commenting "Santa, still getting by on that cheap shit". He later introduces "Detroit Medley" with "Meanwhile back in Detroit, where Santa never goes, because he's afraid of getting mugged..." First confirmed performances in Canada of all seventeen songs played tonight, however it's likely the majority (if not all) were played the previous evening in Montreal.

Audio exists, but is not known to circulate.

THUNDER ROAD / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / LOST IN THE FLOOD / SHE'S THE ONE / BORN TO RUN / PRETTY FLAMINGO / IT'S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY / BACKSTREETS / KITTY'S BACK / JUNGLELAND / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) / SANTA CLAUS IS COMIN' TO TOWN / DETROIT MEDLEY / FOR YOU / QUARTER TO THREE

This show was originally scheduled for Seneca College’s 1,000-seat Minkler Auditorium but due to ticket demand was moved to nearby University Of Toronto’s 2,000-seat Convocation Hall, then switched yet again to Seneca’s larger, 3,000-seat Field House. The various promotional memorabilia (link above) tells the venue story. The above-mentioned 17-song setlist is the complete show. "Thunder Road" is the slow version with Roy on piano and Bruce on harmonica and vocals. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection. "For You" is solo piano. The original taper did not record "Born To Run" and "Pretty Flamingo" or the end and beginning of the songs immediately before and after it.

Audience tape. The entire show was professionally recorded (along with several other shows in December) under the guidance of Jimmy Iovine as part of a plan to release a live album. No part of this recording has been heard in public. A reasonable quality audience recording of nearly the entire show is available on 'Bring Out The Hype', a boot that gets its title from a remark heard in the crowd prior to the start of the show. A low generation upgrade of excellent quality is available as Volume 11 of the 'DS Archives' (mjk5510).

1975-12-26 - BOTTOM LINE, NEW YORK CITY, NY

GLORIA

Bruce turns up for the late show on opening night of Patti Smith's three-night (seven-show) residency at the club. Apparently Bruce is among a group of people (including Creem Magazine founder Lester Bangs) that congregate off-spotlight and supply the background chorus on “Gloria”. This is the first of three low-key guest appearances at Patti Smith shows that Bruce will make over the ensuing 24 months (see November 26, 1976 and December 30, 1977 listings).

1975-12-30 - RADIO STATION WMMR-FM, PHILADELPHIA, PA

Bruce, Miami Steve, Garry, and Danny (and probably Roy too) pay DJ Ed Sciaky an afternoon visit and spend a half hour as Ed's "guest" DJs, spinning some of their favorite platters by the likes of The Drifters, Sam & Dave, Buddy Holly, Sam Cooke, Otis Redding and Them. Ed mentioned during the program that the following night's show (December 31) at the Tower Theater is going to be recorded for "broadcast sometime in the future". We now know that Mike Appel recorded most of the December 1975 shows for possible use on a planned 1976 multi-disc live LP release that never eventuated.

A 35-minute segment of this audio circulates.

Set includes the first "Mountain Of Love" of the tour, last played at Widener College back in February. Miami Steve disappeared from the stage sometime after "It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City" and didn't return. He had the flu. "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out" is the slow version, also played at the Tower Theater two days previous. "Thunder Road" is the slow version with Roy on piano and Bruce on harmonica and vocals. "For You" is the solo piano version. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection. "Twist And Shout" includes "Killer Joe".

Soundboard sourced but suffers from over-recording in parts. Released on CD 'Teardrops On The Tower'. A more recent soundboard upgrade tape has now circulated which has "Wear My Ring Around Your Neck" in a different location and includes the final two tracks not on other releases.

Final slow version of "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out" until the re-arranged solo piano performances at the 1990 Christic Institute shows. Last known "Does This Bus Stop At 82nd Street?" until 1993 in Red Bank and last "Mountain Of Love" until 2008 in St. Louis. "Thunder Road" is the slow version with Roy on piano and Bruce on harmonica and vocals. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes a lengthy mariachi-style introduction and a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection. Steve Van Zandt leaves the stage sometime before the last three songs of the encore, as Bruce alludes to in his introduction to "Quarter To Three". Steve may have still been feeling the affects of the 'flu that also forced him off stage the previous night.

Official concert recording available for purchase in multiple formats, including CD and high definition audio, from Springsteen's official live download site at live.brucespringsteen.net. Soundboard and audience tapes. The entire show (and potentially the entire Philadelphia stand) was professionally recorded (along with several other shows in December) under the guidance of Jimmy Iovine as part of a plan to release a live album. In February 2015 this was the third in a series of archive shows to be officially released and made available for purchase at live.brucespringsteen.net. The recording was mixed from the multitrack reels in January 2015 by Toby Scott and mastered by Adam Ayan at Gateway Mastering. It is available for download in various formats including 24 bit 192kHz high definition FLAC. Previously, a single CD of mixdowns created in 1976 from a 16-track recording of the show circulated which features nine tracks of the eighteen-song set, released as 'The Uber Series Vol 33', remastered as 'Last Tango In Philly' (Ev2) and issued on CDRs 'Dance On Little Sister' (Anubis Records) and 'Philadelphia 1975' (Wet Dreams Records). The complete soundboard recording is available on CD 'Teardrops On The Tower'. An alternative soundboard tape also circulates which does not include "4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)" and both "Detroit Medley" and "Thunder Road" are clipped at the start. The official Wings For Wheels documentary DVD contains great black-and-white footage of the slow "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out" (filmed by early Springsteen fan Barry Rebo), which has been attributed to one of the two Tower Theater shows by an experienced video collector. Subsequently, "Born To Run" from this show was shown by Thom Zimny at the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame discussion in June 2009, and "Mountain Of Love" at "An Evening With Thom Zimny" at Monmouth University on September 23, 2014. This footage was in color with excellent audio.

1976-01-01 - THE STONE PONY, ASBURY PARK, NJ

No set details known. Bruce, as well as E Street Band members Steve Van Zandt and Roy Bittan, turn up at a New Year's Day evening performance by Southside Johnny & The Asbury Jukes. All three end up taking the stage for an extensive, spirited set of oldies. Van Zandt, who at the time was in the studio with Southside and the Jukes producing their debut album I Don't Want To Go Home, actually took the lead vocal on several numbers.
00Photo-32.png

1976-02-00 - THE RECORD PLANT, NEW YORK CITY, NY

Sessions for Southside Johnny & The Asbury Jukes' work-in-progress debut album I Don't Want To Go Home, produced by Steve Van Zandt. Springsteen was present at some of these sessions, particularly during the recording of his composition “You Mean So Much To Me” and he is officially credited on the album as a co-arranger of his two donated songs. Clarence Clemons provided the bass vocal on the other song, “The Fever” but is credited under the fake name of “Selmon T. Sachs”. The album was to be released in May 1976.

1976-03-07 - BEACON THEATRE, NEW YORK CITY, NY

THE LOCO-MOTION

Bruce makes a spur-of-the-moment stage appearance at the final night of Carole King’s three-night residency, singing a rollicking duet with Carole on the evening’s encore, “The Loco-Motion”. There is no circulating audio of this song.

1976-03-21 - THE STONE PONY, ASBURY PARK, NJ

RAISE YOUR HAND

After an eleven week break over the holiday period Bruce & The E Street Band conduct a dress rehearsal performance in preparation for the second leg of the Born To Run Tour (the so-called Chicken Scratch Tour). Only about three hundred invited guests are in attendance. The exact set details are not known, although most of the Born To Run album was played as well as “Raise Your Hand”.

1976-03-25 - TOWNSHIP AUDITORIUM, COLUMBIA, SC

NIGHT / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / SHE’S THE ONE / BORN TO RUN / GROWIN’ UP / IT’S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY / JUNGLELAND / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY)

Partial setlist is known. Opening night of the second leg of the Born To Run Tour, soon nicknamed by the road crew as the “Chicken Scratch Tour” because of the high proportion of secondary market, southern state locations. The above-mentioned partial ten-song setlist is culled from post concert details in the city’s newspaper. The song sequence is correct but there were four or five songs sandwiched in between these that are unverified. This show was not a sellout.

There is no circulating audio.

1976-03-26 - FOX THEATRE, ATLANTA, GA

NIGHT / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT / IT'S MY LIFE / THUNDER ROAD / SHE'S THE ONE / BORN TO RUN / IT'S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY / BLINDED BY THE LIGHT / FRANKIE / BACKSTREETS / JUNGLELAND / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) / DETROIT MEDLEY / QUARTER TO THREE

No complete set details known. Above setlist gleaned from a mixture of newspaper reports and recollections from fans present. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported a 2½ hour show and a near-capacity crowd at this tiny, picturesque venue. A fan (on the Greasy Lake website) recalls 'This was my first Springsteen show and my first trip into Atlanta by myself (I was 18). This unfortunately led to me and my buddies getting lost and missing the first of the show. A guy sitting behind us told us he had opened with "Night". After getting settled in our seats Bruce began the familiar harmonica intro to "Thunder Road". A high energy version followed and this led right into "Born To Run". Since all this happened almost thirty years ago now I can't remember the order in which he played everything but he for sure played "It's Hard To be A Saint In The City" (a great guitar battle between him and Miami Steve), "Blinded By The Light" (he looked over the album cover before starting and said "OK, I got it."), "Backstreets", "Jungleland", an early version of "Frankie" (playing a wooden block with a drum stick for percussion), "4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)" (the angels on their Harleys version) and "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)". He did both the "Detroit Medley" and "Quarter To Three" for encores and ended the night on his knees screaming, "I'm just a prisoner... of rock & roll!" I've never been the same and wouldn't want it any other way.' Assuming these recollections are accurate, this show features the earliest known version of "Frankie" and first known tour appearance of "Blinded By The Light".

No audio known to circulate.
00Photo-32.png00News-32.png

1976-03-27 - RADIO STATION WQXI-FM, ATLANTA, GA

Bruce and Miami Steve visit the station for an hour-long live interview with DJ Cat Simon that was intermixed with both of them playing some of their favorite records for the listening audience.

None of this program’s audio appears to be circulating among collectors.

1976-03-28 - CAMERON INDOOR STADIUM, DUKE UNIVERSITY, DURHAM, NC

NIGHT / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / IT'S MY LIFE / THUNDER ROAD / SHE'S THE ONE / BORN TO RUN / MEETING ACROSS THE RIVER / BACKSTREETS / BLINDED BY THE LIGHT / JUNGLELAND / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / RAISE YOUR HAND / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) / DETROIT MEDLEY / QUARTER TO THREE

The above presumably complete setlist is culled from the audience recording (which contains the full set, save for "Quarter To Three", information from a May 20, 1976 report in Rolling Stone, and a brief review in Duke University's student newspaper. A Brucebase reader present also adds that he recollects "It's My Life" and that "I distinctly remember looking down the row of people and seeing that every single one of them had their mouths open (as did I) in stunned silence, mesmerized by the story and the music. It was thrilling." This is one of only a few shows in which all eight songs from the Born To Run album are performed. First confirmed public Springsteen performance of "Raise Your Hand," and the recording supports that claim as Springsteen calls out chord changes to the band. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection. Some sources suggest that "Kitty's Back" was played, but there is no evidence of it on the audience recording.

Audience tape from the ER archives via JEMS, released as part of the silver set 'Frankie Goes To Cleveland' (Masterpiece) and on CD 'Run South, Young Man' (Godfather). The tape entered circulation in August 2012, prior to this there was no circulating audio.

1976-03-29 - OVENS AUDITORIUM, CHARLOTTE, NC

IT’S MY LIFE / THUNDER ROAD / BORN TO RUN / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) / DETROIT MEDLEY

Complete setlist is not known. There is no known audio from this show. The above-mentioned tracks are mentioned as having been performed in a review the following day in the Charlotte Observer. This was a last-minute addition to the tour itinerary, arranged on only five days notice by a local promoter who became aware Springsteen had an open date available following the Duke University gig. Despite the lack of pre-event promotion Bruce pulled in an enthusiastic, near-sellout crowd of 2,400.
00News-32.png00Photo-32.png

1976-04-01 - MEMORIAL AUDITORIUM, OHIO UNIVERSITY, ATHENS, OH

THUNDER ROAD / SHE'S THE ONE / BORN TO RUN / BACKSTREETS / JUNGLELAND / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / DETROIT MEDLEY

Held in the school's Memorial Auditorium. There was non-reserved seating for this show, which caused mayhem leading up to the venue opening its doors. The partial setlist above is from the confident recollection of Brucebase reader Daniel, who further comments, "The concert was scheduled for around 7:00pm...folks started lining up outside at about 4:30pm. By 7:00pm I'd estimate there were over a thousand people outside and the doors were still shut. At about 7:10 there was commotion up front and I remember seeing one of the doors get literally torn from the hinges - and these were big, heavy wood doors! The next minutes were a blur, seeing one girl getting pushed into the glass marque-poster cases, seeing another girl who fainted getting passed overhead…the mad rush to get a good seat”. Brucebase reader Bob, who also attended comments “Suddenly the doors opened and we were pushed in so I raced to the front and got two seats. I remember the show was a little too loud in the front row, but it was amazing. The night before the show Springsteen went to my favourite bar (Swanky's) and hung out. I didn't go that night. I saw his picture in the paper the next morning standing where I usually went to drink”.

There is no known audio from this show.

1976-04-02 - MACAULEY THEATRE, LOUISVILLE, KY

IT'S MY LIFE / JUNGLELAND / FOR YOU / DETROIT MEDLEY / RAISE YOUR HAND

Partial setlist known. A reader present recalls "My seat was third or fourth-row center but we stood all night. My journal entry doesn't have a list but it mentions a long story intro to "It's My Life", a solo piano version of "For You" that began the second encore followed by a Mitch Ryder medley and "Raise Your Hand" (which I'd never heard before). I see that the April 4 show claims it was the first "Raise Your Hand" but it looks like he played it in Louisville two days earlier. My journal entry says: "Bruce's last words: I'm just a prisoner... of rock'n'roll!". In fact it now seems the earliest known "Raise Your Hand" was March 28 in Durham, NC. A contributor to the Greasy Lake website notes that the set includes "Jungleland".

No audio is known to circulate.

1976-04-04 - MSU AUDITORIUM, MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY, EAST LANSING, MI

NIGHT / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / IT'S MY LIFE / THUNDER ROAD / SHE'S THE ONE / BORN TO RUN / FRANKIE / MEETING ACROSS THE RIVER / BACKSTREETS / GROWIN' UP / IT'S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY / JUNGLELAND / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / RAISE YOUR HAND / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) / DETROIT MEDLEY / QUARTER TO THREE

Show features "Thunder Road" with a new piano introduction. 18-song set includes a rare version of "Meeting Across The River", which is the full-band version rather than a solo piano rendition previously used, and wonderful versions of "It's My Life" and "Frankie". "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" features an extended mariachi-style introduction and a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection. This is also one of the few known times that the whole of the Born To Run album is played. Click the link above to read a review of the show from the Michigan Daily, 'Springsteen underwhelms MSU', as well as a more positive report from the Michigan State News.

Tapeboy was responsible for the excellent audience recording, and he had the following recollections of the show:
“This was my third time seeing Bruce and my first time successfully getting my recorder into the show. It is arguably my best recording set up as well: the Sony 153SD cassette deck and Advent dynamic stereo mics. I also got my camera and a couple of lenses in...ahh...those were the days. MSU Auditorium was (is?) a gymnasium-type place with a U-shaped, single-level balcony surrounding the seats set up on the floor, where we were in the 11th row. This show featured all of Born To Run in an era before full-album shows. It was also the first time I'd heard Bruce play 'It's My Life', 'Raise Your Hand' and the brand new 'Frankie,' which featured Bruce on cowbell and pointed in a songwriting direction away from the sound of Born To Run. 'It's My Life' was stunning, virtually unrecognizable until the chorus, and prompting a standing ovation midway through the song as the band completed the first chorus. Despite Bruce saying on the current River tour that 'Independence Day' was his first song about fathers and sons (and what about 'Adam Raised A Cain'?), clearly the spoken beginning of 'It's My Life' is where he first visited this theme. We left the show knowing we'd seen a great one, and thinking that a new album must be just around the corner; it was unimaginable that Darkness was still over 2 years away!”

Audience tape and partial soundboard. The audience recording is available from the JEMS masters, and is a fine upgrade over previous sources such as CDs 'Livin' Rock 'n' Roll' (Real Thing), 'Hidden Worlds That Shine' (E Street) and Ev2's remaster of the latter titled 'Rise Like the Rain'. CDR 'Come Out Tonight Lansing' on the Midnight Dreamer label utilises the JEMS source. One of the best recordings from the tour and a fine show. The incomplete soundboard is comprised of twelve songs, starting with "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out" and ending after "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)". There are cuts in "Frankie" and "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)".

1976-04-05 - OHIO THEATRE, COLUMBUS, OH

TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / NIGHT / INCIDENT ON 57TH STREET / THUNDER ROAD / SHE'S THE ONE / BORN TO RUN / PRETTY FLAMINGO / BACKSTREETS / GROWIN' UP / IT'S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY / JUNGLELAND / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / RAISE YOUR HAND / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) / DETROIT MEDLEY / QUARTER TO THREE

Following "Backstreets" Bruce talks about the last time he was at the Ohio Theatre in December 1972, when he opened for Sha Na Na. This show was apparently rescheduled from late 1975 due to poor ticket sales. A complimentary review of the show was in a local Columbus entertainment newspaper called Focus, dated April 15-30, 1976. "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out" opens, and the set includes the first known "Pretty Flamingo" of 1976. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection.

Audience tape. Unfortunately, the quality is only average and suffers from distortion during loud sequences. Despite flaws, the recording is perfectly listenable. The tape is nearly complete, with edits at the end of "Incident On 57th Street" and "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)", and most of "Thunder Road" missing.

1976-04-06 - RADIO STATION WMMS-FM, CLEVELAND, OH

Bruce skips the "and now in Zanzibar..." verse of "Blinded By The Light". "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" features a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection.

Soundboard tape released on CD 'Live At The Allen Theatre' (BS), and 'Runners In The Night' (Doberman). A version from a first or second generation reel also circulates, as does a JEMS transfer from what is believed to be a second generation tape. The latter is the one to get, a material upgrade over all other circulating tapes. The JEMS transfer was also released on silvers as part of 'Frankie Goes To Cleveland' (Masterpiece). Eleven tracks (from "Frankie" to the end) are on CD 'Prove It All Night' (Flashback), please note that the date and location listed on the artwork of this CD (May 10, 1976 in Mobile, AL) are incorrect.

Incomplete setlist, likely to be missing "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" and the encores. Bruce slips a few lyrics from "Talk To Me" into the introduction to "She's The One". Set includes rare version of "When You Walk In The Room", only known to have been played once in 1976 and never again until 2009.

Soundboard tape of good (albeit flat) sound dominated by bass guitar is available on CDR 'Leaving The Allen In Rubble' (BTS5) and 'Frankie Goes To Cleveland - Volume 2' (Unknown Label).

19-song set includes "Blinded By The Light". "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" features an extended mariachi-style introduction and a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection. A surprise concert for the university students, arranged the week before and announced on April 5 with tickets going on sale the same day, just after students returned from Spring Break. Tickets were initially only available to Colgate students, an additional 600 tickets went on sale to the general public the night of the show. Held in Starr Hockey Rink at the University's Reid Athletic Center. Despite almost selling out, the event was a run at a loss for the University with Springsteen's $15,000 fee added to the costs of publicity, rented seats, and generators, since Colgate's facilities could not provide the power required for sound and lights. Total costs to the Social Committee was $20,000, the most ever paid out for a concert at Colgate at the time. According to the Colgate Maroon, committee officials felt the return justified the expense.

1976-04-10 - PAUL MELLON ARTS CENTER, CHOATE ROSEMARY HALL, WALLINGFORD, CT

NIGHT / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / IT'S MY LIFE / THUNDER ROAD / SHE'S THE ONE / BORN TO RUN / PRETTY FLAMINGO / INCIDENT ON 57TH STREET / FRANKIE / BACKSTREETS / GROWIN' UP / IT'S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY / JUNGLELAND / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / RAISE YOUR HAND / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) / DETROIT MEDLEY

A special concert played at the request of John Hammond, who was close friends with the family of a Rosemary Hall resident. As a result Springsteen performed for a substantially lower fee than usual. Bruce slips a few lyrics from "Talk To Me" into the introduction to "She's The One". "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes the "Come A Little Bit Closer" introduction and a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection. A Springsteen show regular who attended has commented to Brucebase: "There was no advertising as far as I know. I used to call Mike Appel's office to get Bruce news and they told me. A few other diehards also learned of the show, so the first few rows were full of Springsteen dignitaries who got there plenty early. With my tickets I had Joe Kivak, Simon Montgomery and a female friend of his, a guy named Ernie and his friend, Ed Sciaky. Bruce was blown away when Sciaky showed up backstage. Also up front were Kennie Viola, founder of Thunder Road (fanzine), and some friends of his. Bruce seemed real pleased to see friendly faces at such a strange venue”.

Audience tape that encompasses the complete 18-song performance, recorded by Joe Kivak. This tape now circulates from the master cassettes on CDR 'Walk Softly Tonight' (Fanatic).

1976-04-12 - CAMBRIA COUNTY WAR MEMORIAL ARENA, JOHNSTOWN, PA

NIGHT / BLINDED BY THE LIGHT / FOR YOU / TWIST AND SHOUT

No other set details known. Above very partial setlist known from the recollections of fans present. "Night" opens the set, "Twist And Shout" is the final encore. Venue had a capacity of 4,000 in its concert seating mode. A Brucebase reader who attended reports it was a near sellout, with Bruce dressed in a dark suit (no tie) and Clarence in a white “Panama” suit. Last known full band "Blinded By The Light" until the '99/00 Reunion Tour, where it will make a few appearances.

1976-04-13 - REC HALL, PENN STATE UNIVERSITY, UNIVERSITY PARK, PA

NIGHT / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / IT’S MY LIFE / THUNDER ROAD / SHE’S THE ONE / BORN TO RUN / INCIDENT ON 57TH STREET / FRANKIE / BACKSTREETS / GROWIN’ UP / IT'S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY / JUNGLELAND / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / RAISE YOUR HAND / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) / DETROIT MEDLEY / QUARTER TO THREE / TWIST AND SHOUT

The most frenzied ticket demand show on this final “Chicken Scratch” leg of the Born To Run Tour - people camped out overnight on the Penn State campus for tickets. Bruce slips a couple lines from "Talk To Me" into the introduction of "She's The One". "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection. Following the show it was reported in the Daily Collegian that Springsteen's road manager Richard (Rick) Seguso was arrested and charged with harassment, simple assault and resisting arrest follow events at the concert. Click the date/location link above for more details.

Audience tape available on CDR from Joe Kivak's master cassettes 'Penn State '76' (Fanatic). Seemingly the complete show is captured with just a couple of minor glitches.

1976-04-15 - SYRIA MOSQUE, PITTSBURGH, PA

The above-mentioned twenty-song setlist is courtesy of the best recollection of Brucebase reader Mike, who further comments, “We thought the show had ended after the second encore. We were outside when we heard the crowd go wild. We ran back inside and found the band back on stage, plugging in, with all the house lights on. They must have played “Twist And Shout” for ten minutes. When they finished, they appeared ready to do another number when one of the ladies who ushered the Mosque walked up behind Bruce, tapped him on the shoulder and motioned with her finger "no more". It was a perfect comic ending, as Bruce acted frightened and ran off stage with the others while this 60-year old meanie stood there with her hands on her broad hips”. A glowing review in the Beaver County Times corroborates these setlist recollections.

JUNGLELAND / BORN TO RUN / DETROIT MEDLEY

The above-mentioned three songs are known to have been performed via a (not so complimentary) review of the show in the school’s newspaper. During the finale Bruce was jokingly carried of the stage in a stretcher…only to return for one more song (likely “Quarter To Three”, although the title is not mentioned).

SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / BORN TO RUN / SHE'S THE ONE / JUNGLELAND / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / DETROIT MEDLEY / RAISE YOUR HAND / QUARTER TO THREE

Partial setlist details are known via a following day newspaper review in the Johnson City Press-Chronicle. Johnson City is the home of East Tennessee State University. However there was no school affiliation with this event. Freedom Hall had a capacity of 8,000+ but this gig was presented in the venue’s 3,500-seat “stage show mode”, with half the auditorium curtained and chairs installed on the floor. Due to limited advertising the attendance was less than 1,000.

Complete set details are not known, however the above-mentioned songs were definitely performed. The show opened with “Night”. Like the previous evening’s gig in Johnson City, this was another disappointing turnout, with only about 1,000 of the venue’s 2,500 available seats sold. Brucebase reader Mike (who also noted the small crowd turnout) reports, “I was near the stage and actually patted Bruce on the back when he jumped from the stage and wandered among the audience as he played his guitar. It will always be the best concert I’ve ever seen because of the incredible energy level, as well as the fantastic music and performance by the band.”

1976-04-22 - BURRUSS AUDITORIUM, VIRGINIA TECH UNIVERSITY, BLACKSBURG, VA

A sellout, held in the 3,000-seat Burruss Auditorium. The above-mentioned 18-song setlist is likely to represent the complete show. A review of the show in the school newspaper (linked above) notes that “Detroit Medley” was played. However Bruce was not done yet - following "Detroit Medley" about half the crowd remained after everyone else had left, and the band returned to the stage for "Twist And Shout". “Frankie” makes its second-to-last confirmed appearance on this tour.

The only known source audio is a 16-song audience tape that ends with “4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)”.

1976-04-22 - TOWN HALL, BLACKSBURG, VA

After his concert at Burruss Auditorium Springsteen scooted over to a well-known club called Town Hall to see Nils Lofgren perform. Reports from those present state that Nils asked Bruce to join him on stage but he declined, stating that he was just there for a guitar lesson. Some eight years later Lofgren would join the E Street Band for the mammoth Born In The USA Tour. There are also hazy reports that Bruce (and Clarence) did jam with Nils, but this can't be confirmed.

The above-mentioned nine song titles are articulated in a post-concert review of this performance that appeared in A.S.U. Student Newspaper. There were an additional seven or eight songs performed, but the titles are not identified in the review, although it's likely they correspond to what was played at Virginia Tech two days earlier. This is the last verified live performance of “Frankie” for 23 years.

1976-04-26 - SOLDIERS & SAILORS MEMORIAL AUDITORIUM, CHATTANOOGA, TN

No complete setlist details known. The above-mentioned 13-song partial setlist is the recollection of fans present. Jenny recalls that folks dancing in the aisles during the show were shutdown by security. This elicited boos from the audience, and provoked Bruce to make sarcastic comments about the staff from the stage. Joel, meanwhile, recalls that "the entire upper level of seating, all the way around the inside of the auditorium was curtained off. On the main floor there were two separate sections for seating. There were so few people there that only a few rows in the second section were used. The place really looked empty because it was. I was sitting stage left in the opera section, about four rows from the stage. The opera seating was only a few feet above the main floor level. When the band came out and started the first song, "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out", I remember the stunned looks on everyone’s faces just below me in the audience. I won’t forget that I could see my brother sitting in the aisle directly in front of me about ten people away on the main floor. He was just as shocked as everyone else. It was electrifying."

The setlist is notable for a rare "Kitty's Back", the only known performance of the song in 1976. This gig was originally planned for the nearby (but smaller) Tivoli Theater, yet despite the change of location apparently less than 1,000 of the Memorial Auditorium's 3,850 tickets were sold. Springsteen and CBS publicist Glen Brunmen were interviewed the following afternoon by Nashville's Tennessean newspaper and Brunmen mentions the disappointing crowd turnout in Chattanooga. Bruce also jokingly mentions that their tour bus had traveled an hour out of Chattanooga on its way to Nashville when they had to turn around and go back - they'd forgotten Max Weinberg! Typically Bruce didn't let a small turnout affect his energy level. Brucebase reader Steve reports, “Bruce’s road crew came out before the start of the show and nailed a piece of plywood from the edge of the stage over the top of the security barricades. Bruce jumped off the stage and played in the crowd a number of times. The show still ranks as one of my all-time favorite concerts.”

1976-04-28 - GRAND OLE OPRY HOUSE, NASHVILLE, TN

GROWIN’ UP

Complete set details are not known. This two-hour show took place at the Grand Ole’ Opry’s 4,500-seat venue on the grounds of the then new Opryland U.S.A. Theme Park. Contrary to myth, this was not the first-ever rock show allowed inside the spiritual home of country music, with The Byrds having broken the ice in 1968 at the Opry’s former Ryman Auditorium location. An article in the Nashville Banner the following day (which mentions “Growin’ Up” as having been played) gave the concert a glowing review but reported a crowd turnout of only 3,000.

Excellent set features Eddie Floyd guesting on "Raise Your Hand" and "Knock On Wood" (which includes the only known Springsteen rendition of "Yum Yum Yum (I Want Some)"). "Spirit In The Night" includes a line from "Stagger Lee" in the introduction. "She's The One" includes a brief intro rap. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection. It's after this particular show that Springsteen and Van Zandt take a cab out to Graceland, and Bruce jumps the gate in an attempt to meet Elvis, who is actually in Lake Tahoe. Bruce is escorted off the grounds by security. George "GK" Klein, host of a weekly show on Sirius Radio's Elvis Radio channel and close friend of Presley, has stated that Elvis was aware of Springsteen at the time, and liked him "'cause he was a rock 'n' roller".

When Springsteen returned to Birmingham (and this same venue) on September 29, 1978 (this time to a full house) he recalled this 1976 gig and commented to the crowd: “We don't get down here too much... the last time we were down here you guys must’ve all been outta town”.

Unfortunately a very poor crowd turnout for Springsteen, with only a few hundred tickets sold. Brucebase reader Elaine, who attended, confirms, "Attendance was very sparse. We sat in the fourth or fifth row and there was no one behind us, I think about 200-300. But Bruce played for two hours and seemed to give it maximum effort".

"She's The One" includes a snippet of "Talk To Me" in the introduction. The show includes an interesting arrangement of "It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City" featuring some wonderful interplay between Bruce and Clarence. Possibly the longest known version at nearly seven minutes. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes Roy playing about a minute of Bach's "Prelude No. 1 in C Major (BWV 846)" and a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection. Also a very rare performance of the Gary U.S. Bonds early 60’s classic “New Orleans” (incorrectly listed as “Mississippi Queen” by many sources). Released on the CDR ‘Mississippi Boss’, a title referencing that mistaken song title, not the location of this gig. The audio tape was recorded from the seat shown in the ticket image (link above) and at one point Springsteen jumps off the stage right in front of the taper.

Bruce sings the opening lines of Lloyd Price's "Stagger Lee" as an introduction to "Spirit In The Night". Bruce slips a few lyrics from "Talk To Me" into the introduction to "She's The One". "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes Roy playing a bit of Bach's "Prelude No. 1 in C Major (BWV 846)" and a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection. A fan remembers "Us commoners had to sit in the last five or six rows as the cadets, decked out in dress whites, had all of the rest of the theater. The sound was amazing. The big crescendos of "Growin' Up" seemed to move through us from left to right. I mentioned that to Bruce at the Stone Pony before Southside's May 30 radio broadcast and he said that Eisenhower Hall was supposed to be one of the best acoustic theaters in the country. I believe it."

Southside Johnny & The Asbury Jukes’ first concert with major public exposure hosted by Philadelphia radio station WMMR-FM and broadcast on syndicated stations throughout the northeastern US. This was effectively a celebration of the recent release of Southside’s debut album I Don't Want To Go Home.

Bruce Springsteen joins for one song, the closing "Having A Party".

1976-06-21 - THE MAIN POINT, BRYN MAWR, PA

No set details known. Two shows. Bruce turns up to watch Tone, a group headed by former E Street Band alumni David Sancious and Ernest “Boom” Carter. There are conflicting reports on whether Bruce took the stage during this evening, the confusion may stem from the fact that there were two shows on the night and Bruce may have performed at only one of them.
00Photo-32.png
In early 1976 Springsteen's manager Mike Appel had ambitious plans for Bruce. First, a live album to follow "Born To Run", and then a summer university tour with their own six-thousand capacity portable circus tent. However, Jon Landau convinced Springsteen that both concepts would be mistakes: too early in his career for a live album and the proposed tour would be a logistical nightmare. Springsteen wanted to work with both Appel and Landau while renegotiating his agreement with Appel, since Bruce required more equitable terms as well as complete control over his songs. However, Appel refused to renegotiate. In mid-June 1976 Bruce's representatives informed CBS that he was planning to enter the studio in August (without Appel) to start recording his fourth album, with Jon Landau serving as producer. Two weeks later, on July 2, Mike Appel responded with a letter informing Springsteen that no such recording sessions could take place; Bruce was subcontracted to Appel via Laurel Canyon Ltd., and the agreement that Springsteen signed obligated him to work with Appel and deliver his recordings to Laurel Canyon. On July 27 Springsteen filed a lawsuit in response, accusing Appel of fraud, breach of trust, and undue influence. Just two days later Appel countersued, alleging that Springsteen had breached his contract in a variety of ways. On September 15 a judge ruled that Springsteen would not be permitted to enter a recording studio until Appel's suit was resolved. His hands tied, Bruce had no choice - go back on the road.

1976-07-04 - THE STONE PONY, ASBURY PARK, NJ

Many more songs were played according to the reader who submitted these details - concert included a break and started at around 12.30am. Brucebase reader Paul confirms that the set included "Knock On Wood", performed as a duet with Southside Johnny.

1976-07-22 - CBS ANNUAL SALES CONVENTION, LOS ANGELES, CA

THE FEVER / I DON’T WANT TO GO HOME

Convention promoted as ‘The Family Of Music-1976’ and featuring four artists from the corporate roster, each performing thirty to forty minute sets – Southside Johnny & The Asbury Jukes (who opened), Starcastle, Dave Mason and headliner The Jacksons (featuring Michael Jackson). Springsteen attended and made a guest appearance with Southside Johnny on guitar for "The Fever" and on duet vocals for "I Don't Want To Go Home". Needless to say Bruce received a nicer reception from the reps at this convention than he had before (see July 27, 1973 listing).

The debut of the Miami Horns Quartet (line-up #1), featuring Carlo Novi (sax), Ed Manion (sax), Tony Pallagrosi (trumpet) and Rick Gazda (trumpet). The foursome came from Southside Johnny's Miami Horns outfit during a break in Southside's touring schedule. The show features the premiere of "Rendezvous" and "Something In The Night" - in just piano and organ backing form with the first version of the lyrics. First time that The Dovells' 1963 hit "You Can't Sit Down" is played and the only known version of "She's Sure The Girl I Love".

Audience tape. Two recording sources are available, the first released on CDR 'Sixth Rendezvous In Red Bank', and from Joe Kivak's master cassettes 'Sixth Night at Monmouth Arts Center' (Fanatic). A second source is in limited circulation (Mr. Anonymous). Some, or all, of this show was filmed in colour, possibly by Barry Rebo. The complete "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out" was shown by Thom Zimny at the Rock 'n' Rock Hall Of Fame discussion in June 2009 and again at "An Evening With Thom Zimny" in September 2014. Reports indicate three cameras were used, but only two are visible in the footage that circulates amongst fans. Parts of "It's My Life" and "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out" are seen in The Promise: The Making Of The Darkness On The Edge Of Town documentary in October 2010. Edited video of "Something In The Night" is officially released on the Darkness box set in November 2010 with the final verse missing, for reasons unknown. The missing verse is below. Springsteen would later include a slightly altered version of the third line in River outtake "Take 'Em As They Come".

And now you people out on the island drinkin' tequilas, you lock your doors and take your children by the hand
Put on your black dress baby, because tonight the devil will walk these streets like a man
I don't know about you, but I'm gonna, I'm gonna bring along my switchblade, in case that fool wants to fight
If he wants me tell him I'll be running down the highway, chasing something in the night

Two days after this show Springsteen's lawsuit with Mike Appel begins, with the first hearing. Judge Arnold L. Fein awards a preliminary injunction against Springsteen, preventing him entering a recording studio with Jon Landau.

"Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes Roy playing a minute of Bach’s "Prelude No. 1" from "The Well-Tempered Clavier" in the band introductions and a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection.

Audience tape of good quality with a very enthusiastic crowd, and soundboard for the last three tracks. The three soundboard tracks are on CD 'Deep Down In The Vaults' (E St Records). Collectors should note that the soundboard recording available on CD 'Palace Theater'(Joker) is actually a re-arranged version of August 22. The full, unedited show is available as an audience recording form the master tapes (Mr. Anonymous) on CDR 'Palace In Waterbury' via Fanatic Records. This release patches "Born To Run" from another source but it is unconfirmed if the patch used is actually from this show. CDR 'Waterbury 76' also circulates, which has some tracks from another show grafted on the end. There is apparently around ten minutes of silent Super 8 footage in existence from this show, but does not appear to be in general circulation.

NIGHT / RENDEZVOUS / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / IT'S MY LIFE / THUNDER ROAD / SHE'S THE ONE / BORN TO RUN / SOMETHING IN THE NIGHT / BACKSTREETS / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT (with The Miami Horns) / JUNGLELAND / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) / RAISE YOUR HAND (with The Miami Horns) / YOU CAN'T SIT DOWN (with The Miami Horns)

Although only starting with Springsteen & The E Street Band on August 1, this is the final performance for the Miami Horns Quartet (line-up #1), who must leave to re-join Southside Johnny on tour. Please note that these four guys comprised the entire Jukes Miami Horns line-up at the time. There were no other musicians. They expanded to a five-piece in November 1976 with the addition of Richie "La Bamba" Rosenberg, but between April and November 1976, these four players were the Jukes Miami Horns. The Jukes were off the road while Southside recovered from illness. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes Roy playing a minute of Bach’s "Prelude No. 1" from "The Well-Tempered Clavier" in the band introductions and a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection.

A fan present comments, "So we sit patiently waiting for the band, with no idea what is about to hit us. After a seemingly endless wait, the lights dim and the band comes out and Bam! they burst into "Night" - such a powerhouse version that I can still feel the buzz from it when I think about it. That song is never mentioned as one of the great Springsteen tunes, but since that time, I've always regarded it as one of his finest. I've been a huge rock music fan for all of my life - since those days, I've been a music critic and written hundreds of articles and thousands of reviews and have bought well over ten thousand records and CDs. I've played in my own band, recorded multiple CDs, and run an independent record label, and after all this, I still think of that show as the point where I first saw something that I've only seen a handful of other times: what real rock and roll is."

Soundboard recording and audience tape. For several years, the soundboard had the honour of being the most misdated one. In April 2015 an audience tape (JEMS) from this date was located that finally confirms once and for all that the soundboard recording indeed dates from August 22. The soundboard does not include the final three songs listed above, but they can be heard on the audience tape confirming that the setlist is identical to the previous night's show in Waterbury, CT. The soundboard was first booted many years ago on the old vinyls 'Cry Me a River', 'Live in Philadelphia I and II', and 'Streets of Fire', the last of which was probably the source for the 'Streets of Life' (Flashback World Productions) CD. The audience tape is mostly complete, but the majority of between-song chat and applause is missing. The CD 'Arena Rock' purports to be a complete soundboard of October 25 at the Spectrum in Philadelphia (see listing), but in fact it simply grafts Ed Sciaky's introduction and the encores from that date onto this tape. The CDs 'Palace Theater' (Wild Card) and 'Deep Down in the Vaults' incorrectly date the soundboard to August 21, Palace Theater, Waterbury, CT. The soundboard recording is also available on CDs 'Down In Jungleland Vol. 1' (Winged Wheel), 'Domino' (Dasuye / Odeon Records), and 'Live USA: The Boss Keeps Rockin' Vol. 2' (Imtrat), and CDRs 'Live In Philadelphia' (misdated) and 'Springfield Rock City'.

First official show of the Lawsuit Tour and the debut of the Miami Horns Quartet line-up #2, featuring Ed De Palma (saxophone), John Binkley (trumpet), Steve Paraczky (trumpet), and Dennis Orlock (trombone). Despite the name, this Philadelphia-based foursome has no affiliation with Southside Johnny's band. The group will be a permanent fixture until the tour ends in March 1977, although they're only heard on a few songs each night. "Something In The Night" now features a trumpet accompaniment. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes Roy playing about a minute of Bach's "Prelude No. 1 in C Major (BWV 846)" and a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection.

1976-09-30 - THE ROXY THEATRE, WEST HOLLYWOOD, CA

A TEENAGER IN LOVE

Springsteen and Steve Van Zandt make an unannounced guest appearance (on background vocals) during an encore at Dion DiMucci's second (late) show at The Roxy. Dion introduces the pair as “honorary Belmonts”. Bruce had first met Dion in October 1975 while visiting a Spector-Dion recording session in LA. However Steve Van Zandt, while touring as a member of the backing band for '50s vocal group The Dovells, had actually played guitar in Dion’s backing band at a show in Miami, Florida on December 31, 1972, that trip (according to Steve) being the original source of the nickname “Miami” Steve. Lee Foy, saxophonist with Dion's newly-assembled Streetheart Band, recalls: "Our opening show took place in Los Angeles at the Roxy Theatre. The show was well received. But because we were basically a new group it wasn't that polished. However, it wasn't terrible either. In fact Bruce Springsteen was in the audience and came backstage to offer some constructive criticism which we accepted and put to use."

Setlist is the same as the previous night. Click the link above to view a set of interesting cuttings from the University's newspaper, The Student.

Unfortunately, all available audio attributed to this date has been proven to emanate from a soundboard recording of the August 22, 1976 show at the Springfield Civic Center in Springfield, MA. As far as we know, there is no known audio of this show circulating. Therefore, there is some doubt about the accuracy of the above setlist.

We had proxies stand in for us while we went to (some) classes. The night of the concert was totally worth it when Bruce came right down into the audience to us and sang "Jungleland" and joined us in an arm-in-arm group dance."

1976-10-22 - THE HANGER, HAZLET, NJ

NEW ORLEANS / DEAR LADY TWIST / TWIST, TWIST, SENORA / SCHOOL IS IN / QUARTER TO THREE

Complete setlist details are not known. Brucebase has placed the venue as The Hanger in Hazlet on the basis of a newspaper advert from the Red Bank Register on the day of the concert. Previous information suggested the venue was Fat City in Seaside Heights. If you have any more information about this please get in touch. A discreet Springsteen turns up (apparently as just another paying customer) at a gig by one of his early '60s musical favourites, Gary U.S. Bonds. About half way through the show Bruce takes the stage, borrows a guitar and and provides duet-background vocals for the rest of the show. According to Bonds, Bruce played for nearly an hour. This was the first time Springsteen and Bonds had ever met. Afterwards Springsteen invites Bonds to guest at his show on October 29. In an early 1980s interview Bonds commented: “I was playing down along the Jersey shore. One night the owner of the club came over to me during the show and mentioned that Bruce Springsteen was in the audience and wanted to come up and play. Bruce who? I didn’t recognize the name! But the guys in my band did, so I said OK. When I introduced him the place went crazy… and I’m saying to myself, ‘gee, what on earth is happening here’? After the show Bruce gave me an invitation and about a week or so later I sang during one of his shows”.

Show features Bruce’s earliest known cover of the Darlene Love-Phil Spector classic “A Fine, Fine Girl”. "Growin' Up" includes a version of the spaceman story featuring Ed Sciaky. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" features a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection. This gig has traditionally been noted in books as Springsteen’s first-ever large indoor arena concert as a headliner - however, in reality the Springsteen show at Vets Memorial Coliseum in Phoenix on September 26 probably deserves that title. Click the link above to see some wonderful high-resolution photos, courtesy of Cliff Breining.

Audience tape and partial soundboard, two audience recording sources circulate. A soundboard recording of the encores was released on the CD boot ‘Arena Rock’ (Palace), which is otherwise primarily the soundboard tape from August 22 show. A soundboard recording of "Growin' Up" also exists, probably sourced from Ed Sciaky's radio show. The complete audience recording is available on CDR as part of the Original Master Series. A second source was released as part of the 'DS Archives Volume Fourteen' (mjk5510), missing the last five songs. Nearly fourteen minutes of semi-pro color film footage of excerpts of "Jungleland” and “Born To Run” from this show are in circulation and can be found (with rough soundboard audio) on the DVD ‘Bruce Springsteen: 8MM’ (Brucevideos).

"Something In The Night" features a rewritten last verse which is never used again. "Incident On 57th Street" returns to the set. Bruce again slips in a couple of lines from "Talk To Me" during the introduction to "She's The One", as he did on October 13. "Growin' Up" includes a story about a Catholic school teacher asking students, including Ed Sciaky and Bruce, what they want to be when they grow up. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" features a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection. This show was originally scheduled for October 26 - according to press reports this was due to Clarence Clemons moving to California and being in transit the day of the show. Other reports state this was due to Clarence filming a cameo appearance for the film New York, New York.

Audience tape and soundboard recording. Audience tape source is available on CD 'Spirit Of '76' and 'There's A Spirit Out There Tonight!' (Kivak Master Series). The soundboard recording is complete except "Backstreets" and "4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)" - two tracks as indicated are cut, and "Born To Run" is out of sequence as it was the final track. The soundboard recording of the show is also available on a factory pressed two-CD set called 'Home Of The '76ers', released on the Godfather label.

The only ever guest appearance by Patti Smith at a Springsteen concert, on a customized, one-off, arrangement of “Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)”. Brucebase reader Cliff comments: "I was on the floor taking pictures and saw a commotion in front of the stage… I don't think security knew who Patti Smith was. It took a minute or two before Bruce motioned to let her come up". Patti Smith rants/sings during a special interlude break in “Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)”, with the horns playing what sounds like the riff to "Shotgun" and Springsteen providing a "Land Of 1000 Dances" chant, as well as the usual "Theme From Shaft" snippet. "Growin' Up" features the spaceman story.

Final show of a six-night run in New York City is one of the best gigs of the year, if not all-time. Carl D’Errico (co-writer of "It’s My Life") is in the audience and Bruce delivers one of his finest-ever performances of the song. A stunning cover of The Animals' "We Gotta Get Out Of This Place" is also featured, and to top it all off Ronnie Spector guests on three of her most famous Ronettes-era hits, all given inspired arrangements by the E Street Band. A pre-show bomb hoax results in Bruce jokingly asking the audience to look under their seats. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" features a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection. Bruce recites a tiny section of Joe Tex's "Hold What You've Got" after "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out".

Soundboard recording, which is fortunate as this is quite a unique show. Originally released on boot vinyl LP 'Last Night In New York' (which has Bruce’s bomb scare rap intact) and more recently released on the CDRs 'We Gotta Get Outta This Place' or 'A Streak Of Light Through The Tunnel' and CD 'Paid The Cost To Be The Boss' (unknown label). In August 2011 an upgraded version of the second set emerged which does not dip in quality after "Jungleland", unlike all previous releases.

End of the first leg of the Lawsuit Tour

1976-11-06 - RADIO STATION WNEW-FM, NEW YORK CITY, NY

Bruce went up to WNEW-FM studios in New York the Saturday following his Palladium shows to sit in with DJ Richard Neer. It was an interview with Bruce picking out some records to play. The interview was very topical; reference was made to Bruce shaving his beard, wearing a suit at some performances, Clarence appearing in "New York, New York" etc. Neer also asked Bruce if he would ever play larger venues and Bruce mentions the shows at the Spectrum in Philadelphia. They also talk a bit about Jon Landau which segues into the fact that Landau produced Jackson Browne's "The Pretender" which was released that week and Neer plays a cut from that. Studio cuts were sequed into Bruce songs; "Bo Diddley" into "She's The One", "Mona" into "It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City".

1976-11-07 - THE D’ERRICO RESIDENCE, NEW YORK CITY, NY

IT’S MY LIFE

Bruce visits songwriter Carl D’Errico for a home-cooked dinner and a little impromptu jamming. Carl (co-writer of The Animals’ 1965 hit “It’s My Life”), along with his wife Didi, had been VIP guests at Bruce’s November 4th Palladium gig, where Bruce had mentioned D’Errico to the audience prior to performing the song (it being a regular inclusion in Springsteen concerts at the time). According to interview comments by D’Errico, he and Bruce played a few things together when Bruce visited, including an acoustic rendition of “It's My Life”.

1976-11-26 - BOTTOM LINE, NEW YORK CITY, NY

Early Show: SLOWLY WALKING DOWN THE RIVER / MY CAR WAS INVISIBLE (CASE OF BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN) / PICTURE HANGING BLUES / WE'RE GONNA HAVE A REAL GOOD TIME TOGETHER / YOU CAN DIG IT / AIN'T IT STRANGE / MY GENERATION

Late Show: LAND - NOT FADE AWAY / FREE MONEY / YOU CAN DIG IT / AIN'T IT STRANGE / GLORIA / MY GENERATION

With Patti Smith. Bruce plays piano or guitar on all these tracks, a mixture of spoken word, poems and songs. At the early show, "Slowly Walking Down The River" and "My Car Was Invisible (Case Of Bruce Springsteen)" are improvised, semi-spoken-word pieces performed by Smith with Bruce on piano. "Picture Hanging Blues" features Bruce on piano and Lenny Kaye on guitar. The full Patti Smith Group joins starting on The Velvet Underground's "We're Gonna Have A Real Good Time Together", which features Bruce on piano. He returned later in the show to play guitar on several more songs, believed to have been those listed above. A fan present at the late show recalls "Bruce mostly played guitar since John Cale was on piano for most songs. A few of my photos do show Bruce at the piano however."

Audience tapes of both shows. An audience tape of the early show is available on CDR 'We're Gonna Have a Real Good Time Together' (Original Master Series), while the late show is available on CDR 'You Can Dig It' (Original Master Series). Both are transferred from the master cassettes.

1976-12-00 - CBS STUDIOS, NEW YORK CITY, NY

Sessions for Southside Johnny & The Asbury Jukes’ work-in-progress second album This Time It’s For Real (released in May 1977). Produced and arranged by Steve Van Zandt. Springsteen attended some of these December 1976-January 1977 sessions. According to Steve Van Zandt the two new Springsteen-Van Zandt co-authored songs (“Love On The Wrong Side Of Town” and “Little Girl So Fine”) were written, at least in part, during the times Bruce attended these sessions.

Springsteen may possibly have participated musically during some demo recordings but he is not found on any of the recordings ultimately issued on the album.

1977-01-00 - CBS STUDIOS, NEW YORK CITY, NY

SAY GOODBYE TO HOLLYWOOD

In January, with “Sugar” Miami Steve producing, Bruce joins (on acoustic guitar) for the recording of "Say Goodbye To Hollywood", a Ronnie Spector & The E Street Band single. It was released in April 1977. Bruce’s involvement on the recording was uncredited due to litigation taking place at the time with Mike Appel. However both Van Zandt and Spector have subsequently verified his performance on the recording. Bruce did not perform on the single’s b-side, "Baby Please Don’t Go". Spector did, however, confirm in a 1999 interview that several additional songs (titles undocumented), with Bruce taking a major role, were completed at these sessions - intended for a possible album release that never came to fruition. Spector noted that Springsteen has those unissued recordings.

1977-01-22 - THE JAIL, HILLSDALE, NJ

CAROL / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT)

Springsteen makes a guest appearance with local band Pegasus (Joe Murray (guitar, vocals), Rob Lange (guitar, vocals), Ted Schoenherr (bass, vocals) and Tom Sontag (drums)). A friend of Bruce’s (Matty Delia) managed the band. Max Weinberg also sat in with the band on a couple of different nights. Bruce turned up (but did not perform) at other Pegasus gigs during the period, including one at The Jail on May 21, 1977.

Continuation of "The Lawsuit" tour

1977-02-07 - PALACE THEATRE, ALBANY, NY

The opening night of the very exciting but quite brief (only 33 shows), second leg of the Lawsuit Tour. Most of the setlist for this show is known courtesy of a gig review that appeared in the following day’s Albany paper. There were three or four additional songs played that are not listed above, as they were not articulated in the review. "The Promise" was performed in its piano-solo incarnation. This show included the live debut of the Springsteen-composed "Action In The Streets", which interestingly the reviewer implies actually began this show, although the precise performing order of the overall setlist is uncertain. A contributor to the Greasy Lake website recalls "Spirit In The Night": "What I remember most is Bruce appearing in the audience during "Spirit In the Night." Jumping off the stage into the crowd, body surfing over the crowd decades before the mosh pits of the grunge era".

1977-02-09 - KLEINHANS MUSIC HALL, BUFFALO, NY

SOMETHING IN THE NIGHT / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / IT’S MY LIFE / MONA - SHE’S THE ONE / JUNGLELAND / BORN TO RUN

A very partial setlist (above) is known courtesy of gig reviews that appeared in the following day’s Buffalo papers. With a reported length of only about 1 hour and 40 minutes this would be one of the shorter shows of the era. A contributor to the Greasy Lake website notes "Concert started very late because Buffalo had been hit by an epic blizzard about a week before, and some roads were still pretty bad. Opened with "Something in the Night" (keep in mind, this was before Darkness On The Edge Of Town had been released.) Bruce played a relatively short set, without an intermission. Rumor was that he was not feeling well that night. Still an amazing, high energy show, even if it was a bit shorter." Another attendee mentions that Clarence was all in white, and Bruce entering the crowd during "Spirit In The Night".

There is no known audio.

Great show with a particularly good "It's My Life". Set features the first "Growin' Up" of the 1977 tour and the last recorded version of "Raise Your Hand" for the year. This is the first known show with an intermission. You can hear Bruce say after "Tenth Avenue Freeze Out", "We're gonna take a short break and we'll be back." "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" features a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection. The pass (view by clicking on link above) indicates that either this show was rescheduled from February 10 or is dated incorrectly. First confirmed performances in Canada of "Night", "Growin' Up", "Action In The Streets", and "Raise Your Hand".

Audience tape of excellent quality released on CD 'Soul Crusaders' (ES) and remastered in improved quality as 'No Trouble In Receiver' (Ev2). Later released in June 2015 in upgraded quality via JEMS' 'Nothing To Lose: The 1977 Tour Revisited Volume Six' directly from the master tapes (tapeboy).

Fifteen-song set features the only 1977 performance of "Detroit Medley" and the last "Something In The Night" in the show opening slot. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection. The Michigan Daily noted that "Raise Your Hand" was played with Bruce in the crowd, just as in "Spirit In The Night". "Raise Your Hand" does not appear on the audience tape, interestingly, the taper was on the main floor and states he would not have left before the end of the show after taping Bruce multiple times, he does not feel "Raise Your Hand" was played. Some sources say that Springsteen didn't want to go on stage tonight, however his quote actually emanates from the October 4, 1975 show in the same city.

Audience tape released on CD 'Masonic Temple' (Joker), CDR 'The Devil In Detroit', and in August 2015 from the master cassettes on JEMS' 'Nothing To Lose: The 1977 Tour Revisited Volume Seven' (tapeboy). The sound quality of the latter is a substantial upgrade over the older releases.

SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / IT'S MY LIFE / TENTH AVENUE-FREEZE-OUT (with The Miami Horns) / JUNGLELAND / BORN TO RUN

The partial setlist above is gleaned from a review in the Columbus Dispatch. According to the article Springsteen and Band played for nearly two hours, with ten songs in the main set including four not on record. These four are likely to be "Something In The Night", "Rendezvous", "Action In The Streets" and possibly "The Promise". "Born To Run" was the final song.

Magical show, with Ronnie Spector, along with Flo and Eddie, as unadvertised guests on four songs; three classics from her Ronettes period plus her about-to-be-released single "Say Goodbye To Hollywood", the studio version of which had been recorded with Bruce & The E Street Band just a few weeks earlier (with Miami Steve producing).

Audience tape. Two recording sources circulate, the complete show is available on CDR 'Say Goodbye To Hollywood', while just the four tracks with Ronnie Spector can also be found on CD 'Action In The Streets' (Unbelievable Music). A second high quality source entered into wide circulation in February 2015 (JEMS) as 'Nothing To Lose: The 1977 Tour Revisited Volume One'. This second recording is the so called "official audience recording" recorded by the sound crew using open air mics. Four songs are missing from this recording, a patched version using a low generation source of the first source is available.

The film excerpts have been dubbed with the excellent audience tape and are available on the DVD ‘Bruce Springsteen: 8MM’ (Brucevideos Productions).

First time that the band return to Milwaukee, site of the famous "bomb scare" concert of 1975, so there are constant references to that show throughout. Different venue however, the 1975 show took place at the Uptown Theater. First confirmed performance of the "wishing that God would send some angels" segment of the "Backstreets" interlude. Bruce would use the same phrase in two other songs, "The Fast Song" and some variants of "Something In The Night". "Backstreets" now clocks in at over twelve minutes, and will continue to expand as the tour progresses. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection.

Audience tape released on CD 'Action In The Streets' (Unbelievable Music), 'Milwaukee 1977' (None Listed) and 'Will The Real Bruce...' (Real Live). There is a remaster of the 'Unbelievable Music' bootleg which is a huge upgrade in sound - 'The Return To Bombscare Arena', Ev2. A further upgrade was released in 2015 as 'Nothing To Lose: The 1977 Tour Revisited Volume Three' (JEMS), the third in a series of so-called "official audience recordings" that were recorded by the sound crew.

NIGHT / RENDEZVOUS / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / IT'S MY LIFE / THUNDER ROAD / SHE'S THE ONE / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT (with The Miami Horns) / INCIDENT ON 57TH STREET / BACKSTREETS / JUNGLELAND / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / BORN TO RUN / QUARTER TO THREE

Incomplete setlist compiled from the recollections of fans present and a news review of the show in the Purdue Exponent. The night's proceedings began an hour late due to a piano being tuned. Scott was in the audience tonight, and he writes: "I was at the show in the third row, right hand side. It is farther back than normal third row seats because at the Elliott Hall of Music there was an orchestra pit in front of the stage. During "Spirit in the Night" he jumped into the pit, popped his head up to watch the band before crowd surfing on the left hand side. Only about 3000 of the 6000 available tickets were sold, but by the end of the show, everyone came down from the two balconies and the place was going nuts. The Hall was built for music and the sound was incredible." Scott also provided Brucebase with a great photo of Bruce and the band with the Miami Horns that you can see by clicking on the date/location link above.

No known audio.

Not confirmed that there is an actual recording from this show.

Show includes a particularly fine "Backstreets", including the "...wishing that God would send some angels and blow this whole town right into the sea" lines in the interlude. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes Steve playing a snippet of "The Godfather Love Theme" after he is introduced and a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection.

Audience tape - incomplete (cutting during "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)", but the quality is remarkable for the time. Released on CD 'Jacksonville (& My Father's Place)' (Midnight Beat) and CDR remaster 'Talk It In Our Hearts' (Ev2).

Upon close examination of the audience recording of the March 6, 1977 show at Jai Alai Fronton in Miami, FL it has been discovered it is the exact same recording as 'Jacksonville (& My Father's Place)'. The evidence we have strongly suggests that the recording actually dates from March 6, and therefore no audio circulates from March 4 in Jacksonville. The tapes used for the recent JEMS Archive release of March 6 were obtained in the 80s, pre-dating the 1996 release of 'Jacksonville (& My Father's Place). Unfortunately the taper of this fine recording, John Tsalikes, passed away in 2003. However, if you ever traded either March 4 or March 6 with John or can shed some light on this issue, please get in touch with us.

The cuts to the aforementioned songs are patched with the second source that entered into general circulation in November 2013. This tape has a cut in "Backstreets" but has been patched to complete the song.

1977-03-20 - ALUMNI HALL, PROVIDENCE COLLEGE, PROVIDENCE, RI

NIGHT / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / IT’S MY LIFE / THUNDER ROAD / MONA - SHE'S THE ONE / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT / GROWIN' UP / BACKSTREETS / JUNGLELAND / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / BORN TO RUN / THE PROMISE / YOU CAN’T SIT DOWN

A sellout, held in Providence College's 3,400-seat Alumni Hall. The incomplete setlist details above (missing perhaps two or three songs, but including the final four) are known from reviews of the show in The Cowl (the school newspaper) and The New Paper (a Providence local) along with the recollections of an attendee. Read the full review in The Cowl by clicking the link above. Set features all of Born To Run with the exception of "Meeting Across The River". Bob Walsh was at the show, and particularly remembers "Spirit In The Night", with Bruce jumping off the stage and dancing up the centre aisle. Note: the student reviewer mistakenly identifies the final song of the night as a cover of The Belmonts “Burnt”. However there is no such song by The Belmonts (or anyone else) and it is highly likely that this was The Dovells' "You Can’t Sit Down". The New Paper claims "Sha-La-La" was played, but this is also somewhat improbable since it'd previously only been played in 1975. The reviewer was writing in 1978, and may have been confusing tonight with the 1975 concert at Providence's Palace Theatre, where "Sha-La-La" was performed.

There is no known audio.

Final night of the tour, and a contender for one of the best ever with Bruce in inspired form. Last ever "Action In The Streets" (apart from a 2011 club performance) and last "Don't Look Back" for a long time (1999). Final E Street Band version of "(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher And Higher" until 2009. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes the Miami Horns playing a snippet of "Auld Lang Syne" in the band introductions and a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection. "(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher And Higher" includes a brief snippet of "I Don't Want To Go Home". A fan recalls "I saw the last three shows and they were definitely as good as it gets. We had no idea that Bruce was close to settling his legal problems, but it was clear that these were special. I remember March 24 as being the hottest show but that may just be that it was the first one that featured "It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City" and "(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher And Higher", both showstoppers."

Audience tape released on CDs 'Forced To Confess' (Great Dane), 'Higher And Higher' (Doberman), 'Stranded In The Park' (RCR), 'From The Dark Heart Of A Dream' (Godfather) and JEMS' 'Are You Ready For The Final Moment'. The latter is the best quality, transferred from Steve Hopkins' master tapes. This transfer can also be found on CD 'Are You Ready For The Final Moments?' (Godfather).

The setlist above is the complete show. Two concerts tonight were originally scheduled (along with the two shows the following night) as regular Southside Johnny & The Asbury Jukes gigs. However Southside became ill (suffering from a recurring throat ailment) and couldn’t perform so Steve Van Zandt came to the rescue by organizing The Asbury Park All-Star Revue - a combination of The Asbury Jukes, The E Street Band, Ronnie Spector and Springsteen. Due to Southside's illness and a lack of time for Van Zandt to prepare to lead, tonight's two shows were rearranged into a single concert starting at midnight. Van Zandt was the lead vocalist (with Bruce on guitar/background vocals) on most of the tracks above; Bruce took lead vocals on "The Fever" (backed by the Asbury Jukes), "Thunder Road", "Rendezvous", "Backstreets", and "Born To Run" (backed by the E Street Band), shared lead vocals with Ronnie Spector on "You Mean So Much To Me" (backed by the Asbury Jukes) and contributed backup vocals and/or guitar to many other songs. "Having A Party" includes a bit of "It's All Right" as an introduction. Independent recollections from those present indicate that Bruce was on stage all night, but that cannot be confirmed via the tape alone. If you have any more information, please get in touch.

Audience tape. We are told a soundboard tape of this show does exist, but does not circulate.

Two separate admission shows. Independent recollections from those present indicate that Springsteen was on stage for the entirety of both shows. The gigs were originally scheduled as a standard Southside Johnny & The Asbury Jukes gig. However Southside became ill and couldn’t perform so Steve Van Zandt came to the rescue by organizing The Asbury Park All-Star Revue - a combination of The Asbury Jukes, The E Street Band, Ronnie Spector and Springsteen. Van Zandt was the lead vocalist (with Bruce on guitar/background vocals) on most of the tracks above; Bruce took lead vocals on "The Fever" at both shows (backed by the Asbury Jukes), "Thunder Road" at both shows (backed by the E Street Band), and "(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher And Higher" at the second show (backed by the E Street Band), and shared lead vocals with Steve Van Zandt on "Having A Party" at the early show and with Ronnie Spector on "You Mean So Much To Me" at both shows (backed by the Asbury Jukes).

Audience tapes of both gigs circulate.

1977-05-19 - THE STONE PONY, ASBURY PARK, NJ

JAILHOUSE ROCK / SEA CRUISE

Springsteen turns up on a quiet night (only about twenty to thirty patrons!) and ends up playing with Bob Campanell’s band The Shakes, who were a house band at the club at the time. Billy Smith has commented to Brucebase, “Springsteen was sitting at the bar alone and Campanell asked from the stage if he would like to play… Bruce smiled, put down his beer, walked across the empty dance floor and put on Bob's red guitar… he did "Jailhouse Rock" with all the Elvis moves, and "Sea Cruise" as well”. Springsteen may have also performed during a third song in The Shakes set (“Hit The Road, Jack”), although memories are a bit hazy on this point.

No known audio.

By this time, the court case that was preventing Springsteen from entering a recording studio had been dragging on for nearly a year. On May 28 Springsteen's lawyers finally reached an agreement with Mike Appel, and he was free to record. In return, Appel would receive $800,000 and 50% of the publishing rights to all the songs that Springsteen had recorded up till now. All the rights to the songs recorded in the future would belong to Bruce. Just four days after settling the lawsuit, recording sessions for what would become Darkness On The Edge Of Town began, on June 1. For details on these sessions, see Darkness On The Edge Of Town - Studio Sessions.

1977-05-28 - SPECTRUM, PHILADELPHIA, PA

With his lawsuit with Mike Appel settled only about 18 hours beforehand, an upbeat Springsteen and Steve Van Zandt drive to Philadelphia to attend an Elvis Presley concert. This was Van Zandt’s first Presley show. Bruce had seen Presley in concert once before (at one of the four Madison Square Garden shows of June 9-11, 1972). Although Springsteen was a big enough star at this point to have been given V.I.P. treatment if he’d sought it, Bruce and Steve attended the show merely as members of the public. As fate would have it, this gig in Philadelphia turned out to be one of Elvis’ last. The bloated, drug-affected Presley’s final public performance was a few weeks later in Indianapolis. In a late '70s interview Springsteen commented that he and Van Zandt drove back to New Jersey without saying a word to one another, such was their disappointment with the performance. However, he would later say that he enjoyed the show tremendously.

1977-09-04 - THE STONE PONY, ASBURY PARK, NJ

FUNKY BROADWAY / FARTHER UP THE ROAD

"Farther Up The Road" is the blues song recorded by Bobby "Blue" Bland, and is unrelated to "Further On (Up The Road)", the Springsteen original released on The Rising in 2002. Springsteen guests with guitarist Billy Hector’s short-lived band The Shots - they’d inherited the role of the Stone Pony house band from The Asbury Jukes. Hector would later form The Fairlanes, another band that Bruce would make some shore area guest appearances with.

I DON'T WANT TO GO HOME (with Southside Johnny) / HAVING A PARTY (with Southside Johnny) / THUNDER ROAD / MONA - SHE'S THE ONE / BORN TO RUN

With Southside Johnny & The Asbury Jukes. Benefit concert for Bob Campanell, lead singer of The Shakes. Recollections differ as to if this was with the E Street Band or just Southside and his band, but the general consensus is Springsteen alone, and no E Street Band. Peter Howes' photos from the show would seem to be confirmation. This would mean that the tape allocated to this date is associated incorrectly.

Audience tape (possible).

1977-10-00 - THE RECORD PLANT, NEW YORK CITY, NY

STREET HASSLE

Bruce drops in on a session for Lou Reed’s work-in-progress album and records a Reed-composed, spoken narrative that forms a brief part of Reed’s 11-minute song “Street Hassle”. In the last line of the narrative Bruce states, “tramps like us, we were born to pay”. It’s not known if the inclusion of this line was Bruce or Reed’s idea.

The recording was first released on Reed’s Street Hassle album in March 1978.

1977-10-00 - THE RECORD PLANT, NEW YORK CITY, NY

Springsteen donates songs to Patti Smith, who is recording her new album in the same studios at the same time as Bruce is recording his. According to interview comments in 2000 by Lenny Kaye (Smith’s guitarist and songwriting partner) Springsteen handed over demos of not one but three different songs for Smith/Kaye’s perusal, the first two of which Bruce apparently composed with Patti specifically in mind - and then a third one, “Because The Night”. Smith preferred the latter. After some re-writing of the Springsteen lyrics to give the song a more feminine, sensual feel the Patti Smith Group recorded the song in November. Springsteen didn’t perform on Smith’s studio version. The identities of other two Springsteen-donated songs (Smith never recorded either), remain an intriguing mystery. Kaye’s 2000 comment that “I would love to hear a tape of those (two) songs today” would indicate he doesn’t have a copy of these Springsteen mystery song demos in his collection. The Smith recording of “Because The Night” was first released as a U.S.A. single in late February 1978 and appeared on her Easter album in March. It was a major international hit single during the April-May 1978 period.

BECAUSE THE NIGHT

Springsteen guests on guitar and background vocals during this Patti Smith gig on what in fact was the live world debut (by either artist) of their co-written song "Because The Night". Smith had already recorded and completed her studio version at this point but it was still a couple of months away from being released.

Audience tape of the whole show exists.
00Photo-32.png

1977-12-31 - CAPITOL THEATRE, PASSAIC, NJ

With Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes and the E Street Band: HAVING A PARTY / THE FEVER / I DON'T WANT TO GO HOME / (YOUR LOVE KEEPS LIFTING ME) HIGHER AND HIGHER

With the E Street Band: LITTLE LATIN LUPE LU (with The Miami Horns) / YOU CAN'T SIT DOWN (with The Miami Horns) / DRIVE ALL NIGHT - BACKSTREETS / BORN TO RUN / QUARTER TO THREE (with The Miami Horns)

Springsteen & The E Street Band join Southside Johnny & The Asbury Jukes for several songs and then kick into a set of their own, the first two of which are broadcast live. "Having A Party'" includes a bit of "It's All Right" as an introduction, and "Stagger Lee" includes a brief snippet of "Red Hot" in the midsection. “Backstreets” features the first known version of “Drive All Night” as the intro, or at least lyrics that would end up in "Drive All Night".

Soundboard as well as radio broadcast released on CD 'Catch These Big Stars In The Night...If You Can!' (Eagle Records). The whole set was filmed by the theatre crew and is circulating in very poor quality. Springsteen was not on stage for the three songs between "I Don't Want To Go Home" and "Higher And Higher", which are "Got To Be A Better Way Home", "You Don't Know Like I Know" and "Stagger Lee", with guest Robert Gordon. "Stagger Lee" is unfortunately missing from all bootlegs, but can be streamed on Wolfgang's Vault's Concert Vault along with the rest of the set. The audio quality of this recording is somewhat of an upgrade over other sources. The 'Catch these Stars...' boot has the last three tracks of Springsteen's set from an audience tape, including the complete version of "Backstreets" (which is missing the introduction on the soundboard source).You can download the complete programme for the show by clicking here. It's 6mb and in PDF format.

FASTER AND LOUDER

Springsteen, in the final stages of mixing Darkness On The Edge Of Town, drops by an adjoining studio where New York proto-punk band The Dictators are busy on a work-in-progress third album. Bruce, a fan of the band’s first two albums, winds up contributing the brief count-in vocals for the song “Faster And Louder”.

The recording was first released in July 1978 on The Dictators album Bloodbrothers.

1978-03-17 - TRAX, NEW YORK CITY, NY

WEREWOLVES OF LONDON

Springsteen, along with James Taylor, Linda Ronstadt, J.D. Souther, Dickey Betts (of the Allman Brothers Band) and legendary promoter Bill Graham attend a performance by Warren Zevon at this tiny club then-located at 100 West 72nd Street. Zevon had just begun his Excitable Boy tour and this show (which didn’t start until 3am and lasted for nearly two hours) may have been of an invitation-only or promotional nature. At some point during the show some of the above-noted musicians/celebrities took the stage as a troupe to perform the “werewolf howls” background vocals on “Werewolves Of London”. Springsteen was definitely present but there are conflicting accounts if Bruce was part of the on-stage troupe or not. Springsteen also performed at another Zevon concert three months later (see Brucebase listing for June 23).

1978-05-00 - BOTTOM LINE, NEW YORK CITY, NY

Bruce is in the audience at a Lou Reed show at the Bottom Line. Reed mentions (and greets) Springsteen during his lengthy monologue in "Walk On The Wild Side"..."Hi Bruce. Springsteen is alright by the way. He gets my seal of approval, I think he's groovy. You notice the way the critics turned on him, like after they were on him, right?". It's hard to be certain, but Reed seems to invite Bruce on stage to perform his spoken parts on the song "Street Hassle" that he contributed uncredited on the album of the same title. However Bruce appears to turn down the invitation - you can hear an exchange in the audience during the song (at 6.26), along with what sounds like Springsteen's voice.

Lou Reed's live album Take No Prisoners is a compilation of ten songs from shows at the Bottom Line, recorded between May 17 and 21, 1978.

1978-05-19 - PARAMOUNT THEATRE, ASBURY PARK, NJ

ADAM RAISED A CAIN / FIRE / SPANISH EYES / THE BROKENHEARTED / THE WAY / CANDY'S ROOM / PARADISE BY THE "C" / TALK TO ME / HEARTS OF STONE / PROVE IT ALL NIGHT / RACING IN THE STREET / THE PROMISED LAND / PARADISE BY THE "C" / KING TUT / BADLANDS / NIGHT / SOMETHING IN THE NIGHT / THE PROMISE / IT'S MY LIFE / PARADISE BY THE "C" / BADLANDS / NIGHT / SOMETHING IN THE NIGHT / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / FOR YOU / THUNDER ROAD / PROVE IT ALL NIGHT / THE PROMISED LAND / RACING IN THE STREET / (I CAN'T GET NO) SATISFACTION (instrumental) / HEART FULL OF SOUL / UNIDENTIFIED BLUES INSTRUMENTAL (instrumental) / DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN / ADAM RAISED A CAIN / FIRE / MONA - SHE'S THE ONE / BACKSTREETS

Darkness On The Edge Of Town Tour rehearsals with no members of the public present. These are predominantly full versions with some minor stylistic differences. “The Promise” is the full E Street Band arrangement only played like this on the opening night of the Darkness On The Edge Of Town Tour until the release of The Promise album in 2010 and subsequent performances in Asbury Park the same year and Washington D.C in 2012. The first take of "Prove It All Night" includes the piano / guitar introduction used on the tour. A brief rendition of the song “King Tut” is performed (often mistakenly identified as “Wooly Bully”). Apparently, the performance of "King Tut" results from an episode they saw of "Saturday Night Live" with comedian Steve Martin on April 22, 1978. Martin opened the show with the song, in an elaborate production number. The response to the song was so great Martin released a single in July that made the Top 10. "Unidentified Blues Instrumental" has historically been listed as Led Zeppelin's "Whole Lotta Love", but this seems to be a mis-attribution. The performances of “The Way”, “Spanish Eyes” and “The Brokenhearted” may indicate these unreleased songs had received some consideration for the Darkness On The Edge Of Town album (they were not performed on the subsequent tour). Southside Johnny’s work-in-progress third album sessions were ongoing at the time and versions of the Springsteen-composed “Talk To Me” and “Hearts Of Stone” heard on this tape appear (for some unknown reason) to be playbacks of studio takes featuring Southside on lead vocals. Quality varies quite a lot but there are some real gems in here.

Audience tape released on CDRs 'On Your Mark, Get Set' (B Street) and 'The Complete Tour Rehearsals 1978' (unknown label). Studio takes of several of these songs are released on The Promise, a two-CD album officially released in 2010 - "The Brokenhearted", "Spanish Eyes", "Talk To Me" and "The Way". You can listen to the latter by clicking the link above.

1978-05-23 - SHEA'S BUFFALO THEATRE, BUFFALO, NY

Soundcheck: IS THAT ALL TO THE BALL, MR. HALL - MY GIRL JOSEPHINE - BADLANDS RIFF / THUNDER ROAD / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / IS THAT ALL TO THE BALL, MR. HALL / FIRE / MONA - SHE'S THE ONE

BADLANDS / NIGHT / SOMETHING IN THE NIGHT / FOR YOU / THUNDER ROAD / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / PROVE IT ALL NIGHT / RACING IN THE STREET / CANDY'S ROOM / THE PROMISED LAND / PARADISE BY THE "C" / FIRE / DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN / STREETS OF FIRE / MONA - SHE'S THE ONE / ADAM RAISED A CAIN / BACKSTREETS / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / THE PROMISE / BORN TO RUN / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT / YOU CAN'T SIT DOWN

Opening night of the Darkness On The Edge Of Town Tour. The soundcheck includes extensive workouts of Billy Lee Riley's 1958 rockabilly cut "Is That All To The Ball, Mr. Hall". Includes the only ever live performance of "The Promise" with the full E Street Band until the Asbury Park Carousel web broadcast in 2010. This 22-song set features the world premieres of eight songs from Darkness On The Edge Of Town, the entire album aside from "Factory" and "Something In The Night" (which had made its debut in 1976). "Prove It All Night" has a piano and guitar solo introduction - this will develop and expand throughout the tour, becoming a concert (and career) highlight. The "Backstreets" interlude continues to evolve and the middle section contains the 'Sad Eyes' segment for the first time. The monologue would vary throughout the tour, and often include lyrics also found in "Drive All Night". Two more new songs feature in the second set, the world premiere "Paradise By The "C"" and the live premiere of the Darkness On The Edge Of Town outtake "Fire". A contributor to the Greasy Lake website recalls that Bruce read the lyrics to these two songs from sheets of paper. According to Billboard, opening night was a sellout, with an attendance of 3,187 and gross receipts of $23,200.

Audience tape. Two recording sources circulate, the first was released on CDRs 'Go!' (B Street) and 'Buffalo '78' as well as a low generation transfer as Volume 18 of the DS Archives (mjk5510). A second much improved source was released on CDR 'Darkness Starts Here' and from the master tapes (JC). Also, released on CDR 'Opening Night In The Darkness' which also covers the soundcheck. It is uncertain which source this release uses. The complete length of the soundcheck recording is 38:05, however there are cuts and edits throughout so the actual soundcheck would have been longer.

"Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes a snippet of "Mickey's Monkey" for the first time. "The Promise" remains in the set, but is a solo piano rendition this time. It won't be until 2010 that the full-band version is played again. The stunning solo piano version will remain a fairly regular encore highlight throughout June before dropping out of the set for good in mid-July.

Audience tape. Two recording sources circulate. The first is an unbooted recording of good quality with no cuts as well as an upgraded 2013 tape transfer (mjk5510). A second source from a second generation tape transfer entered into circulation as Volume 10 of the DS Archives (mjk5510), this source is complete and a big upgrade over all other recordings.

The set includes the first "Growin' Up" (without a story) and "It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City" of the tour. The "Mona" intro includes some guitar riffing straight out of The Yardbirds' "Train Kept A-Rollin'." "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes a snippet of The Miracles' "Mickey's Monkey". See the link above for Peter Howes/AsburyBrucePhotos great pictures.

Audience tape. Three recordings circulate, the first is of good quality, recorded fairly close to the stage and released as 'Philadelphia '78 First Night'. The second surfaced in 2013 via JEMS and the ER Archives on 'Thunders Down The Road' and is a substantial upgrade, recorded very close to the stage. It can be identified by some microphone movement before the MC introduction. The third is of average quality, has distant sound and is missing the first two songs of the second set as well as the last five songs. There were clearly some early-tour teething troubles tonight - note the lack of drums in the mix for a good part of "Born To Run". Around six minutes of silent 8mm video footage circulates, including of Bruce disappearing from the stage and reappearing on the upper levels during "Spirit In The Night".

"Jungleland" makes its tour debut, replacing "The Promised Land" as the first-set closer. Four shows into the tour the setlist begins to develop into the familiar Darkness Tour song order, with the first in-order appearance of the "five-pack" of "The Promised Land", "Prove It All Night", "Racing In The Street", "Thunder Road" and "Jungleland". "Growin' Up" includes a brief spoken interlude - "when we woke up...somehow we were in Philadelphia!" "Backstreets" is dedicated to Frank Stefanko. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes a snippet of "Mickey's Monkey".

Audience tape. Two recording sources are available, released on CDR 'Philadelphia 78'. A second source surfaced in 2016 and was released as part of the 'DS Archives Volume Sixteen'.

1978-05-29 - MUSIC HALL, BOSTON, MA

Soundcheck: includes POINT BLANK (see notes)

BADLANDS / NIGHT / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / SOMETHING IN THE NIGHT / THE PROMISED LAND / PROVE IT ALL NIGHT (cuts in) / RACING IN THE STREET / THUNDER ROAD / PARADISE BY THE "C" / FIRE / ADAM RAISED A CAIN / DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN / GROWIN' UP / IT'S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY / MONA - SHE'S THE ONE / BACKSTREETS / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / THE PROMISE / BORN TO RUN / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT / YOU CAN'T SIT DOWN

Five songs from the start of the set listed above are either from recollections of those present or a review in the Boston Globe, so they might not be accurate. It's likely that "For You" was played after "Something In The Night". According to the Globe review, there was a five-hour soundcheck/rehearsal before the show. "Racing In The Street" segues directly into "Thunder Road" from this show onwards. "Growin' Up" features a story about a gypsy woman, with Bruce singing a line from the Curtis Mayfield tune of that name. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes a snippet of "Mickey's Monkey". Click the link above to view Cliff Breining's great shot of the Boston Music Hall marquee, as well as a newspaper review of the show. In a telephone interview with WBCN Boston's Mark Parenteau on September 26, 1978, Bruce revealed that "Point Blank" was musically composed during soundcheck before one of the three shows at the Music Hall. The lyrics were written on the road after the Boston stand, and the song was premiered at The Roxy on July 7. This soundcheck could have taken place before any of the three Boston gigs, and maybe over more than one soundcheck session.

Incomplete audience tape available on CDR 'Where Dreams Are Found And Lost', part of the Kivak Master Series. The tape consists of sixteen tracks beginning with "Prove It All Night" in progress.

Near-complete setlist is known, perhaps with one or two songs missing. In all likeliness "Badlands" opened the show, but we have no audio or documented evidence. This is Springsteen’s second appearance at the Academy (he’d previously played here on May 28, 1976). Unfortunately the only known audio source is incomplete (it includes the above-noted setlist up to and including “Backstreets”. The last three tracks noted in the above setlist were apparently also played, including a repeat performance of "Sea Cruise" that is unique to the 1976 and 1978 Naval Academy shows alongside one further performance at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado on August 16, 1981. A midshipman threw his hat on stage during “Sea Cruise” - Bruce grabbed it and wore it during the song. 'Growin' Up" features the spaceman story.

Audience tape (incomplete). The Darkness On The Edge Of Town album is released on this date.

1978-06-06 - INDIANA CONVENTION CENTER, INDIANAPOLIS, IN

BADLANDS / PROVE IT ALL NIGHT / THUNDER ROAD / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / BORN TO RUN / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT / QUARTER TO THREE

Partial setlist above constructed from the recollections of those present. Famous show when three female dancers from a nearby strip club called ‘The Red Garter’ joined Bruce and the E Street Band onstage during the encore – an incident that Springsteen alluded to 18 years later during a November 21, 1996 solo gig in Indianapolis. An attendee confirms the strippers story, noting that Bruce introduced them as "some friends that Clarence made this afternoon". Apparently Bruce was surprised when they appeared - "I don't think he was expecting them to actually come on stage from the wings." The attendee also notes that Springsteen opened with "Badlands". The Friddles (a.k.a. Bob) has written to Brucebase with more detail: "After leaving the stage after their last set to thunderous applause, they returned for an encore and I believe there were three young ladies in long dresses and high heels came out with them, who were introduced as friends they met at the Red Garter Lounge (which we knew was a “Gentlemen’s club” in Indy). The girls starting dancing as the band performed, then to my amazement, they proceeded to wriggle out of their dresses and continue dancing and singing with the band in only their skimpy bras, garters, panties and high heels – I was amazed! The crowd went wild!"

In October 2010 during his "Big Band" tour show in Indianapolis Max Weinberg also talked about this event. On the day of the concert the soundcheck finished early and the band headed off to 'The Red Garter' for an afternoon's relaxation. Clarence ("a man of varied interests" according to Max) befriended the strippers, invited them to the show (unbeknownst to the band) and finally invited them on stage for a memorable "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out". During the concert in Indianapolis in March 20, 2008 Springsteen again mentioned The Red Garter, expressing surprise that the club is still in existence. Total ticket sales for the show were 2,014, with gross receipts of $15,105.

"Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes an instrumental snippet of "Hernando's Hideaway" as an introduction. "Growin' Up" features the spaceman story. An attendee who snuck into the arena before the show recalls that "Let's Live For Today" was soundchecked. The song was originally recorded by English band The Rokes in 1966, and later popularised by The Grass Roots in 1967. As far as we know, it has never been played in concert. Total ticket sales for the show were 4,739, with gross receipts of $33,420.

"Growin' Up" features the spaceman story and "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" features an extended mariachi-style introduction. Total ticket sales for the show were 6,428, with gross receipts of $44,966.

The above-noted twenty song setlist (likely to represent the entire show) is taken from an incomplete audience tape of the show combined with an attendee recollection that's deemed reliable. Allegedly this audience tape exists in complete form but it’s not in collector circulation – our understanding is the non-circulating segments suffer from technical problems. Just over ten minutes of Super-8, color film footage of this show is in circulation (sometimes incorrectly noted as being from November 29). This footage encompasses excerpts of five songs - "Badlands" and "Night" (both originally without sound), as well as excerpts of "Spirit In The Night", "She’s The One" and "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" (all with sound). The two songs with no audio have recently been ‘married’ to this show’s previously circulating audio and the complete footage with audio is now available on the DVD ‘Bruce Springsteen: 8MM’ (Brucevideos).

The complete 21-song setlist above is courtesy of Brucebase reader Chris, who made a note of the setlist the day after the show. "The Promise" returns to the set. Chris also writes: "I remember when Bruce was standing on the speakers about ten feet off the floor during "Quarter To Three". He was shouting "I'm Just A Prisoner.." before collapsing on the stage. Clarence revived him with a sponge, and he got up after about a minute and finished singing "...Of Rock 'n' Roll!". During "Spirit In The Night" he did his usual routine and went into the crowd, this time he went further than normal with Clarence trailing behind him playing his sax and Bruce singing the lyrics. He got close to me, and I got a chance to touch him when he was singing the line "me and Crazy Janey". I was so excited! When the silent part ended; he jumped back up and with Clarence right behind him, they ran back through the crowd onto the stage." Another fan present was Jeff, who writes "The set list was very similar to Kansas City later in the month. Only concert I have still ever attended where NOBODY was selling tickets outside, all the people outside were trying to buy!" "Racing In The Street" and "Jungleland" are mentioned in a very positive review in The Daily Iowan. A contributor to the Greasy Lake website notes "...he was standing on top of the speakers and he jumped down like a giant cat. And I remember him out in the audience... grabbing a reporter's pad and telling him he better be writing a good review." Billboard magazine reported an attendance of 2,568 and gross receipts of $20,177.

1978-06-17 - KIEL AUDITORIUM, ST LOUIS, MO

QUARTER TO THREE

No other set details known. Held in the 10,000 seat Kiel Auditorium, and one of the few gigs on the Darkness Tour with a disappointing turnout – over 5,000 tickets remained unsold. Billboard magazine reported an attendance of 4,516 and gross receipts of $33,612. A Brucebase reader comments: “I remember when the lights came up at the encores that I was stunned that there were only a few rows of the upper level filled - for what was the most amazing show I'd ever seen”. A contributor to the Greasy Lake website mentions that "Quarter To Three" was played. In a 1978 magazine interview Clarence Clemons mentioned this gig as one of his favourites of the tour. When Springsteen and The E Street Band returned to St. Louis on November 25, they performed in the much more intimate 3,500 seat Kiel Opera House. Michael Stipe is believed to have attended this show or the later Opera House show, noting that it changed his life.

1978-06-23 - PARAMOUNT THEATRE, PORTLAND, OR

I’LL SLEEP WHEN I’M DEAD

As he had done a couple of months earlier in New York City, Springsteen makes an unannounced guest appearance at a Warren Zevon gig – this time playing guitar, harmonica and sharing vocals on a wild, extended version of "I’ll Sleep When I’m Dead", Warren’s final encore of the evening.

Jim, sent his recollections of the evening to Brucebase: "The house was about half-full. Zevon was fairly popular at that time, with college kids and so forth. My good friend and I were set to see Bruce (for the first time!) the following night, but we had tickets to see Zevon too. We took our spots about fifteen rows out from the stage in the Paramount Theatre. As we sat down, we couldn't help but notice four, or five guys behind us. They seemed familiar, but were dressed differently from the Oregon fans. Oh well, I really didn't give it much thought... Zevon came on. He was horrible. This was during a period of his career when he was drinking too much. It was pretty evident throughout the show that he was a wreck. The show was low energy, and just not good. Nobody got up, not even to bring him back out after the set was done. However, as the obligatory "give us an encore" applause continued Zevon and band came back out. Still no standing ovation. Then.... from stage right, this figure appears. He comes bopping out onto the stage- he's wearing the newsboy hat, he's got on a black jacket and has an Esquire slung around his shoulder. The place went CRAZY! It was Bruce!! All at once the roof went off - everyone was standing and screaming, and the half-full venue now seemed to be jam packed. Zevon launched into "Sleep When I'm Dead." Bruce joined in and handled the harmonica parts and some stinging guitar riffs. It was amazing. This made the evening worthwhile. Oh, and those guys sitting behind us? Now I recognized them! It was Miami Steve, Garry, Roy and probably Danny (memory is a bit hazy after all these years, no Clarence though)."

1978-07-04 - RADIO STATION KMET-FM, LOS ANGELES, CA

Bruce, Jon Landau and Dave Marsh turn up together at the studios of KMET – resulting in a lengthy, live on-air Springsteen show hosted by DJ Mary Turner. Springsteen-Landau arrived bearing audio treats – the show is highlighted by the debut public airing of two live recordings (“Prove It All Night” and “Paradise By The "C"”) fresh from the gig in Berkeley (July 1). Many topics are discussed, from what Asbury Park is like on the 4th, how the change in drinking age to age 18 saved him and the band in the local bars, The Bruce Springsteen Band doing "You Mean So Much To Me", Ronnie Spector, how the album version of Something In the Night came from their first session when they recorded thirteen songs, the asylum gig when he was 16 and the patient who introduced the band for almost 20 minutes, the Sing Sing prison gig (December 7, 1972) where they had no vocal mics and they had to play all instrumentals but were dying until "a black cat" got up on stage and played a little soprano sax and then everyone went nuts, Appel trying to get Bruce to sing at the '73 Super Bowl, Bruce tells a story about his dad taking him to Tijuana & getting their picture taken on a Zebra - but it was really a painted donkey, Because The Night, Patti Smith & how that happened, Bruce talks about Asbury Park characters and that he made names up, fireworks over the ocean - which leads to playing the album track, Fourth of July, Asbury Park (Sandy), and Turner asks about the song, Independence Day - somehow she had heard about it already.

After playing "Racing In The Street", Bruce admits he got it wrong when the song opens and he sings: "I got a sixty-nine Chevy with a 396 / Fuelie heads and a Hurst on the floor." He had recently been approached by Richie Schultz, a Grand National car driver, and was told that "Fuelie heads will not fit on a 396!" They will fit a 283. Bruce says, "This depresses me!". Bruce muses on changing it to "a 283" at shows but then says something like, "My job is to write the songs. I don't have to fix them" and then laughs. Bruce then tells that he sold his '57 Chevy with the flames and got a '60 convertible midnight blue Corvette. They finish up with his thoughts about the time it took to do Darkness & the lawsuit. Bruce says they recorded about thirty songs for the album. Mary Turner then gets in her final question: "Did you really find the key to the universe in the engine of an old parked car?" The interview ends with the live debut of "Paradise By The "C"" from the July 1 Berkeley show. Bruce was clearly taken by Mary, even going so far as to ask her out on a date and dedicating "The Promised Land" to her the next night at the Forum on July 5: "this is for, uh...this is for Mary down at KMET, see, you guys, you guys can't see what she looks like, she's real pretty and I asked her for a date last night, I don't know if she's gonna go out with me or not, this is for her."

Several hours after this interview Bruce, Clarence, Garry and a couple of members of their tour entourage sneak up on the roof of a building on Sunset Strip and spray paint the huge billboard advertisement promoting the Darkness On The Edge Of Town album.

The complete event (interview and songs) can be found on the two-CD set ‘Darkness On The Air’ (Mystic).

CAROL

Springsteen and actor Gary Busey (of The Buddy Holly Story movie fame) join obscure Oklahoma-based country rock outfit The Old Dog Band for a song. One of the band members was Gary Busey’s brother. Busey would later join Bruce on stage for several songs at the Spectrum in Philadelphia (see August 18 and August 19 listings). At the August 19 show Bruce says he and his sister Pam went to see The Buddy Holly Story while he was in Los Angeles.

Remarkable setlist includes the premieres of "Point Blank", "Rave On" and "Heartbreak Hotel". Probably one of the best shows Bruce will ever do. Another live debut "Independence Day" is performed solo on piano for only time on the tour. "Point Blank" features different lyrics to later versions and is played slightly differently. Also includes the first known tour performances of both "Twist And Shout" and "Raise Your Hand".

FM broadcast. Originally broadcast on KMET FM Radio, and on some recordings "Point Blank" and "Thunder Road" have been edited where the original broadcast suffered from interference. Unfortunately this show only circulates as recordings from the radio broadcast unlike the other radio broadcasts from this tour which have pre-FM sources available. Recordings circulate on many unofficial LPs and on CDs 'Roxy Night' (Crystal Cat) and 'Hands Towards The Sky' (Lobster Records) and 'Roll Your Tapes' (Growin' Records), CDRs 'No Private Party. (Ev2) and most recently 'Out There In Radioland' (JEMS), a transfer from a first generation 7-1/2 IPS (inches per second) reel. Released to retail in the UK in February 2015 by Roxvox, and in May 2015 by Leftfield Media. This show was one of the main source concerts for the official Live 1975-85 box set, which includes no less than eight recordings from this show - “Spirit In The Night”, “Paradise By The ''C''", “Adam Raised A Cain”, “Growin’ Up” (with a few cuts in the middle-part “lawyer” story), “It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City”, a heavily edited “Backstreets” with the "Sad Eyes" sequence removed and part of the third verse switched with a different performance, “Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)” and “Raise Your Hand”. Another performance recorded that night, “For You”, was later released as a B-side/bonus track on 7”/12” vinyl worldwide, and on CD on the Japan only Live Collection EP. In addition, a short live excerpt from this show (Bruce’s speech given after “Badlands” about a photo recently taken of him) was officially - and exclusively - released on a promotion-only 7” flexidisc issued to subscribers of Austrian pop magazine Rennbahn Express in June 1981.

Film of “Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)", "Prove It All Night", and "Badlands" were originally released promotionally – with the most widely distributed promo, “Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)”, later issued commercially (in edited form) on Springsteen’s Video Anthology video / DVD set. The full version, including band introduction, was subsequently released on the DVD set The Old Grey Whistle Test. The two other verified Levine film recordings from this show currently circulating are “The Promised Land” and “Born To Run”. All five have surfaced as bonus material on the Watchdog DVD 'Live On The Darkness On The Edge Of Town Tour' in outstanding quality; obviously taken a very low-generation copy of the master. A circulating film clip of “Raise Your Hand” is also from this show. The five promotional videos were officially released on the Darkness On The Edge Of Town box set in November 2010, re-edited with previously unseen camera angles by Thom Zimny. Several film clips from this show can also be seen in the promotional music video for "Save My Love".

1978-07-09 - KING BISCUIT FLOWER HOUR, SAN DIEGO, CA

Springsteen is interviewed by WNEW-FM DJ Dave Herman for King Biscuit Flower Hour, a weekly syndicated program heard across the United States. Again, as was done a few days earlier at KMET-FM in Los Angeles. Being interviewed by friendly Dave Herman, Bruce opens up about a lot of the Darkness issues Herman asks about. During the interview, Herman poses questions to Bruce about being the person or the product - Bruce talks about having more money than you can spend, then come the distractions, what he wanted to be, THE Billboard Incident, how "The Boss" got started, whether he has any kind of life outside of music, how he cares about his fans, how The E Street Band got together - Bruce tells a great bit about Garry getting into the band, if he's having a good time and the Phoenix show - Bruce tells about young girl who kissed him so hard that she almost knocked out his front tooth, the age he decided to get into rock 'n' roll, the Born To Run hype and feeling things slipping away, the Darkness album being something new or a continuation, how Bruce and Landau hooked up, Born To Run recording issues, Born To Run and Darkness - time to do them, how he feels about Darkness - Bruce says, "I like it . . . in general, I think it's an honest record," number of songs done - again, Bruce says "about 30," hardest track to get down - Bruce agrees with "Badlands" & adds, "It was hard to sing ... I had the word, 'Badlands' and chord changes and we go into the studio and lay the track down ... And I go home. I play the tape and I'd write the words but I wouldn't do it out loud, I'd write them in my head. So, I go into the studio and I'd try to sing it and I realized what I'd written was like, it was hard to breathe and sing it all at once, so that was hard to sing," about being a rock 'n' roll star - Bruce hopes it doesn't mean a day will come when he can't get down into the crowd, and problems he's faced due to popularity - Bruce talks about the conflict between wanting to reach out but then feeling like you got to pull back but "the main thing is to cut down on the distance . . . to get as close as possible to the audience ... the whole concept is the people come and they're at the show, well, they're not at the show, they're in the show, you know, I'm not only in the show, I'm at the show ... I'm not explaining it well ... it's a paradox ... the more popular you are, the further people have to sit away to see you but you're reaching more people ... what are you gonna do ... you gotta work it out somehow. Somewhere in all that, they're talking about the music business and it's challenges and Bruce coins the term, "Capital Generator" and what that feels like. Bruce uses this term, "Capital Generator" in the opening segment right after "Paradise By The "C"", thru "Incident On 57th Street" and before "Racing In The Street" gets played in a great summation of all that came before the Darkness tour in response to Dave Herman's opening: "What's Up?"

Live recordings of “Prove It All Night” and “Paradise By The "C"” from the Berkeley July 1 gig are broadcast as part of Bruce’s interview appearance at the station. The entire Herman program (interview and music) is available on a bonus CD with Crystal Cat’s 'Agora Night' package. A 29:11 edited version was also released on Bruce Springsteen: The Classic Interviews CD by Chrome Dreams in 2005. This omits the two live songs and about thirteen minutes of the broadcast interview.

As had been the case during every Texas tour since 1974, Springsteen proved very popular in Houston and Austin - but for some strange reason had trouble selling seats in Dallas. This show had originally been scheduled for the main 10,000 seat Convention Center Arena but due to poor advanced ticket sales it was shifted to its 1,700 seat Theater. When the Band returned to Dallas in December they would play the larger Arena. A Brucebase reader who attended comments “Concert-goers had to exchange their tickets, so there was a delay in starting the show. People were starting to get impatient and began rhythmic hand clapping and foot stomping. The MC made one announcement, but it didn't let up. All of a sudden out comes Bruce, who said something like "O.K. you guys! Hang on for a little longer until we get everyone in. We have a long show ahead of us tonight!” In the event, Billboard magazine reported a sellout attendance of 1,761 and gross receipts of $12,327. A comment on a Dallas Observer blog post claims that Springsteen played a solo piano "Independence Day", however this cannot be confirmed.

Audience tape. The above-mentioned, slightly incomplete setlist is taken from an audience tape, as released on CDR 'Get Outta My Face'. "Growin' Up" includes the "let it rock" story. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes the "Come A Little Bit Closer" introduction. "Quarter To Three" was played as confirmed by someone who attended but does not appear on the circulating tape.

Bruce's first and only performance in San Antonio, TX. Springsteen gives the crowd a choice of either "Candy's Room" or "For You" - he plays both. First known version of "The Fever" since 1974, apparently played in response to calls from the crowd. "Growin' Up" features the spaceman story. Prior to the show Springsteen was interviewed over the telephone by KLBJ-FM's Steve Smith.

1978-07-15 - RADIO STATION KILT-FM, HOUSTON, TX

Springsteen drops into the KILT-FM studio in the afternoon for a 30-minute chat with DJ Ed Beauchamp which was broadcast live. This interview (which isn't widely circulating) includes a confirmation by Bruce that his performance of “The Fever” the previous night in San Antonio was his first since the Liberty Hall show of March 10, 1974.

Dave's breakdown of the interview for Brucebase.
Topics discussed include asking Bruce about having no opening acts and what gets played at a show, to which Bruce replies that there are kids who only see you once a year and this is his night and there are songs he wants to hear, Bruce even says that about himself. "When I see someone, 'I hope he plays that'." The Fever comes up and Bruce tells about how it got to Texas and became popular down south but not in the northeast but also admits that it was "a throwaway song." Then, there's a really long pause, which causes Bruce to chime in with, "You guys are full of questions!" and chuckling. Then that woman talks about the frisbees flyin' around at the show the night before in San Antonio with a couple hitting Steve and one hitting Max. Evidently, Bruce didn't notice them getting hit as he said, "What was their reaction, did they have any reaction?"

Next, they discuss Bruce's going out into the audience and Bruce says there's been no problem yet . . . it's a certain one-on-one thing that happens...and calls the seats in front of the speakers, "suicide seats." They ask about "Growin' Up" with the "God Damn Guitar!" rap being long and if he ever hears anyone say, "Get on with it!" Bruce says, "Figured they fell asleep through half of it - that's why they're so quiet!" Larger venues comes next. Bruce says, it hasn't changed that much [What a difference between his fear and the reality]...the crowd's the same and they come to "see the show" and not be drugged out...though the fan reaction is different in a really nice place, like those with reclining seats..."Man, that's hard to get them up!". Newer, nicer places are harder than the old smaller beat up places...The Roxy was great. They ask about playing bars and Bruce tells a bit about playing with Gary Busey in Calabasas, CA on his night off on July 6. He reveals that the bar held about 70 and was an old Pony Express store..."just go out and do it, have fun."

A major topic follows where they get into what Bruce tries to do at the show with the audience. Bruce says "Lots to play to who you can see, but that's a mistake. There's lots more in the dark...seats go way up there...always conscious of that...just 'cause you can't see them, they're up there." The DJ asks if a big PA doesn't compensate for that? Bruce continues with...it's a mental thing that connects...if 100 rows, there are people in the 100th row...I try to watch what's going on so it's good for all. There's balcony people...there's people all over...when lights go up in a big place and you wave to someone in the last row, you know that they know that you're waving at them...it's funny how direct you can be...wave in a specific direction and zero in...a small amount know you're comin' at them...I have a certain conscious thing to play to who's out there...not just the first five...it makes a difference.

Then, Ed Beauchamp starts to Dave Marsh the interview as he rambles on about lots of topics like the band, 'C' being a cheerleader and not just a sax player, a new kind of R 'n' R, comparisons to Dylan and Chuck Berry, what Darkness is really about, etc. but he never really asks Bruce any questions, thus leaving Bruce only with short, kinda curt responses with Bruce finally dumping this on Ed, "You're doing great, I think you should do this!" Ed does get in one great point about Darkness (his fourth album) is really like it could be a first album for him, as it's totally new. "Worse thing you could have done was to try to follow up Born To Run with the same style...totally different chapter." On the difference between Darkness and Born To Run albums, Bruce says he was going for more of a live sound than a studio with overdubs...wanted less controlled sound...says Something In The Night and Darkness On The Edge Of Town were done live in the studio...Bruce says you hear the live Prove It All Night & the difference is "night & day. Big difference!"..."I guess I could sell out, do a live album or something." NOTE: Such an odd, even bizarre comment for someone who is renowned for his live performances, yet he feels it's a sell out to release an album with those live performances on it, but, he records every show, just in case.

Beauchamp than describes Darkness as "very intimate, not claustrophobic, lots of open spaces, not hemmed in by despair - always light at tunnel's end - not negative." To which, Bruce mumbles a bit, trying to deal with Ed's big picture there, before he says, "lots of people interpreted it wrong...it's about everyday people who try to hold on to what people try to beat out of you." Bruce says, "Yeah" when Ed says, "It's kids having a hard time. Through the songs, you make people think about their own situations." NOTE: In later years, Bruce has said somewhat the same thing about his songs. Next, Ed asks him if the more successful he becomes, will it make it harder to relate to his fans. Bruce gets going here with, "can be distracted by money, cars...from beginning, I played for different stakes...that stuff's the booby prize...settle for that, might as well throw it all away...you win or lose it on the inside...if I don't do what I should do, no matter what I ride home in that night, I know I'm not gonna sleep."

The last big area discussed is women. Ed throws it all at him with "Women always seem to be important - always one in the background...how important are women in your life? You're not chauvinistic in lyrics, treat ladies well but they don't seem to treat you the same...Do women help or distract? [Bruce says, "Cuts both ways."] Can't tell with some songs - is it a one night stand or she does seem to be treated nicely but is it repaid in kind?...You don't have contempt for women or treat as sex objects [Bruce says, "I don't operate on that level - too romantic to do that."]...lot of romanticism in songs..." Bruce dodges most of all that but then sums it all up nicely with, "Someone asked a similar question, why characters were so (?)...On Darkness On The Edge Of Town it's isolation. On "Darkness On The Edge Of Town", it's one of the first songs where the character ends up by himself. I don't know how it all fits together. I guess it mirrors what I go through myself. It's a drag. With a girlfriend, you go into to make a record & that's the end of that. I'm real hard to be with. Real uncompromising on a lot of things. I'm not at an age where I want to compromise on it yet. I'm in a place where there's one thing that matters to me. Sound very fanatical about it in an almost crazy kind of way. Don't want to surrender to that." Ed says, "That rock 'n' roll," to which Bruce just says, "Yeah" and it's over.

An attendee recalls that "the show started about forty minutes late because the stage motor burned out and they couldn't move the stage back so some people didn't have seats. They were offered their money back but wanted to stay. Bruce came out and apologized for the delay and said he and the band would try to make up for it with the show. THEY DID! To this day, still the best I ever saw." Show includes an instrumental version of the song "Honky Tonk" which was originally a #2 record for Bill Doggett in 1956. According to historian Priore, this was the first rock 'n' roll instrumental hit, and the Beach Boys were the first, and one of the only, surf bands to cover it. "Growin' Up" features the goddamn guitar story. A newspaper review of the August shows in New York City states that "Heartbreak Hotel" was played tonight: "You never see the same show twice. He's got a limitless repertoire. When he played New Orleans, something happened with the sound system. So they all got out from behind their instruments and they all sang "Heartbreak Hotel" spontaneously." Unfortunately this event cannot be corroborated by the audience recording. Billboard magazine reported an attendance of 5,000 (a sellout) and gross receipts of $35,644.

To start the show Bruce announces "They're Off!" in recognition of the Kentucky Derby and after Clarence plays the brief "Call To The Post - Boots and Saddles" intro. "Growin' Up" includes the teenage werewolf story. Bruce loses his place during “Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)”, which results in an unusual instrumental break until he picks up the song again; the song also contains a snippet of "Macho Man" after Clarence's introduction. Following this show Springsteen gives a backstage interview to journalist David White, which was first broadcast on September 3 on Radio Station 2SM in Sydney, Australia as part of an in-house produced “Bruce Springsteen Story” history-music-interview Special (it included the live “Prove It All Night” promo audio from the Berkeley July 1 show).

There were only three or four exceptions and this show was the most glaring one - with just 3,000 of the 6,500 tickets sold. The majority of the setlist above is taken from an partial audience recording, taped on a 8-track recorder, the rest from the recollections of those present. Several songs are still missing, however. We have independent reports that "Prove It All Night" was particularly spectacular, with one attendee blown away by the power of Springsteen's opening chord of the introduction, as it ricocheted off the back of the stadium. At the conclusion of the song, Bruce noted that the guitar was particularly loud, A brief review, which incorporates an interesting post-concert backstage chat with Bruce, mentions “Growin’ Up” (with the ‘Let It Rock’ story) as having been performed. No other titles are articulated. Contributors to the Greasy Lake website recall that "Spirit In The Night" and "Sherry Darling" were played. Bruce was on a guaranteed performance fee but mentions in the interview that he is going to compensate the show's promoter for the financial loss sustained. Setlists and/or audio long-circulating and alleged to be from this gig are in fact slight permutations of the audio from the November 25 show in St, Louis, MO. Consequently Kalamazoo’s seemingly strange setlist (for the mid-tour period) is incorrect and “The Ties That Bind” did not make its world debut at this August 7 show.

No circulating audio.

1978-08-08 - RYERSON THEATRE, RYERSON UNIVERSITY, TORONTO, ON

Cancelled concert (probably prior to any public announcement of its booking), never re-scheduled. In August 1978 Ryerson University was known as Ryerson Polytechnical Institute and this gig, noted in some in-house CBS Tour Itinerary documentation, was planned for the school’s 1,200 seat Ryerson Theatre. Reason for the cancellation is unknown.

1978-08-09 - THE AGORA, CLEVELAND, OH

Soundcheck: SUMMERTIME BLUES

SUMMERTIME BLUES / BADLANDS / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN / FACTORY / THE PROMISED LAND / PROVE IT ALL NIGHT / RACING IN THE STREET / THUNDER ROAD / JUNGLELAND / PARADISE BY THE "C" / FIRE / SHERRY DARLING / NOT FADE AWAY - GLORIA - SHE'S THE ONE / GROWIN' UP / BACKSTREETS / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) / BORN TO RUN / BECAUSE THE NIGHT / RAISE YOUR HAND / TWIST AND SHOUT

Free concert to celebrate the tenth anniversary of WMMS, although the anniversary was somewhat artificial - it actually marked the change of call letters from WHK-FM to WMMS. The radio station drew postcards to give away almost 1200 tickets to the show. Broadcast by WMMS and simulcast by WABX in Detroit, WDVE in Pittsburgh, WEBN in Cincinnati, WLVO in Columbus, OH, WXRT in Chicago, KSHE in St. Louis and KQRS in Minneapolis with a total audience for the broadcast estimated at three million. Denny Sanders was the on-air DJ, while Kid Leo introduced Bruce on stage: round for round, pound for pound, there ain't no finer band around, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band! It's interesting to note that this show was later mastered by Bruce's management and given to KSAN in San Francisco who broadcast it as a replacement for a scheduled Winterland rebroadcast some time in 1979, WNEW-FM in New York City for a broadcast on Easter Sunday of 1979 and WWDC 101 in Washington D.C. on November 5. The song order of the WNEW-FM broadcast was adjusted, and the tape was edited to remove references to Cleveland. WMMS themselves also rebroadcast the entire gig on November 5. This remastered tape has fantastic stereo separation and coupled with the fact that this is a good show in the first place, it has to rank as one of the best of the available shows in 1978. 22-song set opens with "Summertime Blues" and closes with "Twist And Shout", performed some time after the radio broadcast had concluded. "Backstreets" is dedicated to Jim Kluter and Joe Juhasz, two of the 'Cleveland Boys', a group of hardcore fans that first met Bruce in Asbury Park in 1976, joining him for a benefit softball game. It's Jim and Joe's voices that you can hear along with Bruce's singing "explode into rock 'n' roll bands" during "Jungleland". Clarence's intro during "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" contains a snippet of The Village People's hit "Macho Man".

In May 2012 Cleveland's Plain Dealer reported that Agora owner Henry LoConti was attempting to release a four-CD set of the show. While one audio feed (for radio, produced by Jimmy Iovine) went to a production truck (actually an old school bus converted into a recording studio by Sam Kopper, a former announcer at Boston's WBCN) outside the venue, another went to Agency Recording, a studio located above the Agora, which recorded the show onto 24-track tape for a possible live album. (Although it appears that the masters LoConti owned were only 2-track. Perhaps while a 24-track feed did go to the recording studio, LoConti only kept a mixed-down, 2-track version. The location of any multi-track masters is currently unknown). LoConti transferred this tape and made ten copies of the box set, which also includes Springsteen's June 1974 set at the Agora. Copies were sent to Springsteen, Steve Van Zandt and Springsteen's management asking permission to issue the set, with all proceeds going to the Western Reserve Historical Society. Unfortunately, no permission was forthcoming. In addition, LoConti also claimed that the set includes an extra track not included on bootlegs, but as far as we know, "Twist And Shout" was the final song, a position which is supported by press and fan reports. "Twist And Shout" was not included in the original broadcast, and may have been missing from the earliest vinyl bootlegs. "Twist And Shout" was first broadcast the following day, and on subsequent rebroadcasts of the show. Sadly, Henry "Hank" LoConti passed away in May 2014.

Official concert recording available for purchase in multiple formats, including CD and high definition audio, from Springsteen's official live download site at live.brucespringsteen.net. Soundboard and radio broadcast tapes. In December 2014, this was the second in a series of archive shows to be officially released at live.brucespringsteen.net. The seven 15ips, half-track tapes located by Toby Scott were transferred via the Plangent Process, the same analogue tape restoration technique used to good effect for the November 2014 box-set release of Springsteen's first seven albums (although Plangent was not used for The River). and mastered by Gateway Mastering. The show is available as a three-CD set, as well as MP3, FLAC, ALAC and 24 bit 192kHz high definition FLAC. The audio quality of this transfer is a fine upgrade over any previously available bootleg. Also released on various bootleg LPs and CDs including Crystal Cat's 'Agora Night' (the best quality available from bootleg sources, transferred from pre-FM reels), 'Just In Time For Summer' (no label listed), 'Agora 1978' (Super Sonic) and 'Summertime Bruce' (E Street Records). Released to retail in 2014 under the title 'Agora Ballroom 1978' (Left Field Media). This is not an official release.

"Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes a snippet of "Macho Man" during the band introductions. Final encore song is "Quarter To Three". Billboard magazine reported an attendance of 5,984 and gross receipts of $42,729.

Complete set details not known and no known audio. Above songs are culled from attendee recollections of the show, and a review in the Bangor Daily News from August 14, 1978. This is likely to represent the majority of what was played tonight - one or two songs may still be missing. It's highly likely that "Because The Night" was played after "Born To Run". The attendee also notes that during a great version of "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)", Bruce was acting up running around before running to the microphone and announcing "someone stop me... before I hurt myself" and collapsing to the stage. Clarence rushes over to play sax over him and a few girls rush the stage and huddle around him until he revives and they are whisked away and he continues. "Growin' Up" features a mid-song story with him being chased by armed forces and "Backstreets" features Bruce referencing the singer Stevie Lawrence and singing a Lawrence song "Pretty Blue Eyes" before going back to "...hiding on the backstreets". The back of the stage area of this 8,700 seat venue was curtained off and consequently the seating was reduced to 6,000 for this show. Billboard magazine reported an attendance of 5,892 and gross receipts of $48,780.

First known "High School Confidential" to start off the show. Set also includes the first "For You" of August and another outing for "Sweet Little Sixteen". "Growin' Up" features the teenage werewolf story. Bruce sings a line of "Pretty Flamingo" during "Backstreets". "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes an instrumental snippet of "Macho Man" during Clarence's introduction.

Audience tape (Unbooted), "Prove It All Night" is marred by severe tape drag and cut short. A second, higher quality and complete source surfaced in 2017 and was released as Volume 24 of the 'DS Archives' (mjk5510).

A concert perhaps best known for the outstanding video footage available. "Growin' Up" features the teenage werewolf story. "Backstreets" has some lines from "Pretty Flamingo" in the 'Sad Eyes' section. Tremendous versions of "Quarter To Three" (particularly the video) and "Prove It All Night" with the cab driver intro and an outstanding guitar solo. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes a snippet of "Macho Man" during the band introductions. "Jungleland" cuts after Steve's guitar solo, and the start of "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" is also missing - presumably due to tape changes. The show features a particularly loose and active Bruce, maybe because the next day he was going home to New Jersey for the first time in a year. The MC that can be heard introducing Springsteen before "Summertime Blues" is the legendary Washington-area DJ Don "Cerphe" Colwell.

Audience tape and soundboard from the video feed. The video now circulates in good quality on DVD 'I F*cked Everything Up'. Available on CDR 'From Town To Town' and 'It's Such A Sight To See'. The video footage was released (in upgraded quality) as a factory-pressed two-DVD bootleg called 'Live On The Darkness On The Edge Of Town Tour' on the Watchdog label.

1978-08-18 - SPECTRUM, PHILADELPHIA, PA

Soundcheck: THE FEVER (several takes and chatter) / THE HARDER THEY COME (several takes) / SAVE THE LAST DANCE FOR ME

Audience tape of the soundcheck. Likely taped outside the arena, with lots of audible arguing and traffic noise. Tracks are reasonably clear throughout. Jimmy Cliff's "The Harder They Come" is an astounding, majestic rearrangement of the reggae classic. A high quality recording of this would be a stunner. It won't be until 2012 that Springsteen actually plays "The Harder They Come" in concert, in Austin accompanied by Jimmy Cliff.

Gary Busey guests on "Rave On" and "Quarter To Three". "Growin' Up" includes the teenage werewolf story. WIOQ Radio DJ Ed Sciaky interviews Bruce backstage after the show - this is broadcast the very next day, on August 19.

Two recording sources available. The first circulates on the LP 'The Philadelphia Special' and on CDR 'Racing In The Street' (Fanatic). The second source entered circulation via JEMS and the ER Archives (No. 7) from the master tapes in June 2013. This tape is a huge upgrade and one of the best quality audience recordings of the Darkness Tour, made complete using patches from 'The Philadelphia Special'.

Gary Busey guests again on "Rave On". "Growin' Up" includes the story of Bruce meeting Clarence. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes the "Come A Little Bit Closer" intro. "Quarter To Three" includes "Oh, What A Night" in the midsection.

Incomplete soundboard recording released on CD 'The Jersey Devil' (Golden Stars) and also in improved quality from a soundboard tape which belonged to Ed Sciaky. Audience recording also exists. 'How Sweet It Is' (Fanatic) is a composite of the two former sources, in an attempt to construct the best quality, most complete recording. "Good Rockin' Tonight" is played for the first time as well as "The Fever" once again. "Prove It All Night" fades out at the end, "Racing In The Street" is missing from the soundboard, but confirmed as played via the audience tape. "Thunder Road" fades in, "Growin' Up" is edited and "Quarter To Three" fades out. The recording of "Prove It All Night" found on The Jersey Devil is a fake, actually sourced from a completely different show.

Brucebase contributor Chris Prondzinski has some interesting news. "In February of 2016, I bought a lot of over 100 Springsteen items on Ebay. I bought it mainly for the 3 8mm film reels and a VHS tape. On two of the reels (I still do not know what is on the third reel, I will send Brucebase the info when I get a chance to play it this summer) and the VHS tape are of a August 22, 1978 show at Madison Square Garden in New York City. The man who filmed it, whom I never met, was a huge Springsteen fan. The footage itself is of decent quality in color, with some shaking here and there but not much and not for long. He also recorded audio with the show and dubbed it onto the VHS tape. Sometime in the summer, I plan to take the original footage on the reels and remaster it a bit, and put it on a DVD. I will then dub a great audience tape from the show onto the newly remastered footage. I will then created another DVD of the show, and distribute it into circulation. Until then, nobody will see the show. The project will be done by the end of summer, so do not fret collectors, I will try to get it to you as soon as possible! But until then, this is all you have.”

Audience tape. Released on CDRs 'MSG Night 2', 'Edge Of Darkness' and the excellent quality CDR 'Good Rockin' Tonight' (Fanatic) from Mr. Anonymous's master cassettes.

1978-08-25 - TOAD'S PLACE, NEW HAVEN, CT

ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / DOUBLE SHOT (OF MY BABY'S LOVE) / YOU CAN'T SIT DOWN / PRETTY FLAMINGO

Bruce and Clarence join Beaver Brown. Apparently, the whole band were at the club but they didn't all play. Brucebase reader Phil recalls "Beaver Brown played "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" at every show back then, so they knew it cold. Bruce was psyched and he and John Cafferty kept huddling after each song to figure out what to play next. I think I remember them playing "Midnight Hour", "Double Shot (Of My Baby's Love)", and "You Can't Sit Down", but it was crazy and we may have had a few beers, there could have been more (or fewer) songs." Bob Harris, of Old Grey Whistle Test fame, recounts this show in his biography The Whispering Years. He recalls the band playing "Pretty Flamingo" and also states that a 'section of the set' was recorded.

This was not captured on the circulating audience tape. "Growin' Up" includes the 'teenage werewolf' story, which features a few rapped lines of "Maybellene". A 15-minute interview with Robin Young is recorded by WBZ TV prior to the show. Click the link above for several fantastic photos courtesy of Peter Howes/AsburyBrucePhotos and a newspaper review.

The setlist above is perhaps complete (although not necessarily in the right order), with maybe one or two titles missing, at most. Culled from reports in the Pittsburgh papers and attendee recollections. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports that all but one of the Darkness tracks are performed, "Adam Raised A Cain" being the only absentee. Another Pittsburgh newspaper mentions “Something In The Night” returning for the first time in a couple of months, while the Pittsburgh Press mentions a stunning piano solo rendition of “Lost In The Flood” that opens the second set and played as a special request - and Bruce utilizes his lyrics notebook to ensure he doesn’t mess it up. The song is dedicated to Blaine, who had recently been killed in a motorcycle accident. Click the link above to read reviews from the Beaver County Times and Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. "Quarter To Three" features Bruce and Clarence atop the speaker stacks on opposite sides of the stage, before Bruce climbs on to the Big Man's shoulders. They both continue to play while Clarence walks around. The final encore also includes a stretcher brought on stage by two men dressed in white. Tour premiere of "Lost In The Flood", and first performance of the song since December 27, 1975 in Philadelphia. Billboard magazine reported an attendance of 3,489 (a sellout) and gross receipts of $29,236.

There is no circulating audio from this show.

GOOD ROCKIN' TONIGHT / BADLANDS / STREETS OF FIRE / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN / HEARTBREAK HOTEL / IT'S MY LIFE / FACTORY / THE PROMISED LAND / PROVE IT ALL NIGHT / RACING IN THE STREET / THUNDER ROAD / JUNGLELAND / PARADISE BY THE "C" / ADAM RAISED A CAIN / CANDY’S ROOM / THE FEVER / LOST IN THE FLOOD / GROWIN' UP / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) / NOT FADE AWAY - SHE'S THE ONE / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / BORN TO RUN / BECAUSE THE NIGHT / QUARTER TO THREE

The 24-song set above is the complete show, courtesy of Brucebase reader Chris, who was present. "Lost In The Flood" makes another rare appearance in its piano-solo incarnation, and "It's My Life" is played again after premiering the previous night. "The Fever" is dedicated to Southside Johnny, who would return the favour later that same night, see the listing below for details. Another reader present comments: "I can tell you he opened with Elvis's "Good Rockin' Tonight", and played almost the same show as the Detroit show right after -- "Badlands", "Spirit in the Night", "Streets Of Fire", "Darkness On The Edge Of Town", the "life story" version of "Growin' Up", et al. He did that incredible solo piano version of "Lost In The Flood", a killer "Born To Run". He also played "4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)" and encored with "Runaround Sue" with all of the house lights on. What a night!" Despite this recollection, "Runaround Sue" was not played, it was in fact "Quarter To Three" with a few lines from "Runaround Sue" added. Following the show WNEW-TV filmed an interview with Bruce for its PM Magazine programme.

1978-08-31 - THE AGORA, CLEVELAND, OH

THE FEVER (with Steve Van Zandt and Clarence Clemons) / I DON'T WANT TO GO HOME (with Steve Van Zandt and Clarence Clemons) / HAVING A PARTY (with Steve Van Zandt, Clarence Clemons, and Roy Bittan)

Bruce (and several E-Streeters) with Southside Johnny in the early hours of August 31 following their gig at the Richfield Coliseum. "Having A Party" includes a bit of "It's All Right" as an introduction. Springsteen only features on the three songs listed above, but Clarence Clemons and Garry Tallent also perform on at least one more song, "Stagger Lee", video footage of which also circulates. A fan present writes, "We were at the Agora on August 31. We had tried desperately to get tickets for Bruce that night at the Coliseum but it got sold out. The Agora gig was actually a Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes gig that started about three hours late because, as Southside stated, they had to wait for their lead guitarist (Miami Steve) to get done with another gig across town. Bruce joined the band in the second set and they rocked into the wee hours of the night, neither the band nor the crowd wanted to leave... it was about 4am when we finally got home (with little, or no voice). Great intimate concert with Bruce and Southside."

Soundboard tape and excellent pro-shot film which is readily available on DVD.

1978-09-01 - MASONIC TEMPLE THEATRE, DETROIT, MI

GOOD ROCKIN' TONIGHT / BADLANDS / STREETS OF FIRE / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN / HEARTBREAK HOTEL / FACTORY / THE PROMISED LAND / PROVE IT ALL NIGHT / RACING IN THE STREET / THUNDER ROAD / JUNGLELAND / LOST IN THE FLOOD / CANDY'S ROOM / ADAM RAISED A CAIN / CHIMES OF FREEDOM / MONA - SHE'S THE ONE / GROWIN' UP / BACKSTREETS / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / BORN TO RUN / BECAUSE THE NIGHT / QUARTER TO THREE

Set includes the solo piano version of "Lost In The Flood" which was only played three times on the '78 tour. This was the last known version of the song until the final show of the 2000 New York City stand. Also features the premiere of Dylan's "Chimes Of Freedom", which will be resurrected on later tours. Bruce reads the lyrics from a music stand. "Growin' Up" includes the 'Teenage Werewolf' story. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" features a whistled intro. Excellent show.

Audience tape. Released on CD 'Darkness At The Heartbreak Hotel' and four songs are included as bonus tracks on 'Winterland Night' (Crystal Cat). CDR released in 2010 'Wild Cathedral Evening' (JEMS / Flynn) from the master cassettes - a considerable upgrade. Video footage of the first three songs also circulates - the end of "Good Rockin' Tonight", most of "Badlands", and the start of "Streets Of Fire". This film is probably recorded by a local news crew.

1978-09-02 - PINE KNOB MUSIC THEATRE, CLARKSTON, MI

Springsteen, Ken Calvert (area Promotions Manager for Columbia), as well several others in the Springsteen entourage take the Darkness Tour bus to Pine Knob to catch a Bob Seger & The Silver Bullet Band concert. Bruce had mentioned to Calvert (who knew Seger) that he wanted to see Michigan’s favorite son in action. This was the first time Seger and Springsteen (mutual admirers of each others work) had ever met. Seger was aware Springsteen was coming and delivered an extraordinary performance. Following the show Springsteen and Seger spent a considerable amount of time backstage chatting, talking shop and singing some impromptu oldies. It has been speculated that Springsteen’s exceptional show and one-off performance of “Hang Up My Rock And Roll Shoes” the following night in Saginaw was inspired by this night’s events. Bob Seger would join Springsteen onstage for a memorable guest appearance on October 3, 1980 at the University Of Michigan.

Only tour performance of Chuck Willis' 1958 hit "Hang Up My Rock And Roll Shoes," which would reappear 31 years later on the final night of the Working On A Dream tour. One of the last performances of "Growin' Up" of this tour - and a great version. This show is said to be one of the finest of the tour - a performance that often lives in the shadow of the radio broadcasts but is definitely on the same level of the "big 5" despite the limitations of an audience recording. The tape does not include "Because The Night" but it is unknown whether Springsteen skipped it or if it is merely missing from the recording. As far as we know It has been ever-present in the set since June 30 in Berkeley.

Audience tape. Released on CD 'Killers In The Sun' (Winged Wheel) a re-master of that boot was released as 'Isn't Canada A Long Ways From Here' and several songs are bonus tracks on 'Roxy Night' (Crystal Cat). Also available from the JEMS master cassettes, the quality of this transfer is a substantial upgrade over 'Killers In The Sun'. This particular source can also be found on CD 'Saginaw 1978' (unknown label). Meanwhile, on this day an interview with Bruce recorded August 6, 1978 is aired on 2SM Sydney, Australia.

Last "Summertime Blues" for the tour. "Growin' Up" features the teenage werewolf story. Review in local paper has "Quarter To Three" as last song. This concert was originally scheduled to take place on April 24, 1978, but it was moved after the start of the tour was put back a month or so.

Audience tape (Unbooted). Incomplete tape that fades at the end of "Because The Night". The second set cuts in right at the start of "Sherry Darling", suggesting that perhaps one or two other songs are missing.

"Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes the "Come A Little Bit Closer" introduction. Billboard magazine reported an attendance of 4,381 (a sellout) and gross receipts of $34,793.

Audience tape (Unbooted) of good quality available on CDR 'Uptown Theatre' and also a 2013 transfer from JEMS' digital clone of the analogue master titled 'Relentless As The Rain'.

Premiere of "Double Shot (Of My Baby's Love)" which is excellent, followed by the first Springsteen performance of "Louie Louie". Set opens with "Badlands", the first time since August 5 that Springsteen has not opened with a cover. An excellent review by Stephen Belmont in The Observer, the school's student newspaper, confirms that "Racing In The Street" and "Jungleland" were also played (the latter closing the first set), and it's highly likely that "Thunder Road" was sandwiched between the two. Belmont's description of the events at the end of the show is worth repeating here: "Halfway through [Quarter To Three], the lights went up and some people started to leave. Others couldn't leave. They were hooked, blind drunk on a triple shot of Springsteen rock. They screamed, stammered, and waved their arms, paying no attention to the roadies who had already removed one of the big curtains from behind the stage. Meanwhile, behind the stage friends of mine encountered an exhausted Springsteen. 'They're not going to leave,' said one, 'until you play one more.' And play one more Bruce did. And those who had waited 'Twisted and Shouted' for a final, frenzied, fun-filled, fabulous time." Billboard magazine reported an attendance of 5,310 and gross receipts of $38,996.

Audience tape (Unbooted) released on CDRs 'The Hunchback Of E Street' and 'South Bend '78'. The tape is incomplete, cutting during "Prove It All Night" and missing the end of the first set. Also available in upgraded quality from a second generation tape transfer (mjk5510).

Full setlist now known. An reader contributed his memory of the night and states that he recalls "The Fever" as part of the set. Set includes the first "Detroit Medley" of the tour. Billboard magazine reported an attendance of 6,630 and gross receipts of $49,090.

Another fan pointed out that the boot LP 'Lip Sync In Cincinnati' is from this show but it turns out that the boot is actually a selection of tracks from September 19, so there is no known audio circulating from this show. This particular night was the special broadcast of a two-hour special radio show on King Biscuit Flower Hour (KBFH) which was a series of interviews and mostly album tracks but also included two live cuts from July 1.

During "Spirit In The Night" Bruce enters the audience while sitting on Clarence's shoulders and "Quarter To Three" features two bogus doctors carrying Springsteen off stage after he collapses on the piano. Click the link above for more insights from newspaper reviews of the show, including the story of how a group of Colgate University students sneaked into the arena after the show and surprised Bruce in the shower.

Audience tape (Unbooted) of good sound quality. "Darkness On The Edge Of Town" is missing from this recording, but given the edit on the tape and previous setlists it was certainly played between "Spirit In The Night" and "Heartbreak Hotel".

Show opens with "Darkness On The Edge Of Town", only ever done three times (Meadowlands on August 9, 1999 and Dublin on May 27, 2016 are the other two), and the song is dedicated to Muhammad Ali who would defeat Leon Spinks in the Heavyweight Championship fight in New Orleans the same night. The last "Adam Raised a Cain" of the tour is played, as well as the last known version of "Something in the Night" until the 1999/2000 Reunion Tour, and the first known version of "Kitty's Back" since March 1976, played because someone in the crowd was yelling for it so much that Bruce asked the crowd to shut him up. Cliff confirmed that "Quarter To Three" was the final song of the night. WPLJ DJ Carol Miller interviews Bruce backstage after the show.

Audience tape available on CDR 'Kitty's Back in New York' and 'First Palladium Night - Live In New York City Night 1' (Earlmv).

Set includes the first "Point Blank" (with a still-evolving lyrics/arrangement) since July 7. "Independence Day" also returns, performed with the band for the first time. "Backstreets" is dropped from the show for the first time on this tour, but is replaced by the tour debut of “Incident On 57th Street”. "You Can't Sit Down" returns to the set, last seen at the beginning of June. A news review says that "Meeting Across The River" was played, but Springsteen's comments before the song the following night ("we haven't done this in a long time, we're gonna try...") indicate that this is an error.

Audience tape (Unbooted) released on 'Saturday Night At Newyork Palladium' (Midnight Dreamer). Following the show DJ Vin Scelsa from New York radio station WNEW-FM records a 15-minute interview with the E Street Band, which is broadcast on September 19 along with the live broadcast of that show.

Released on CDR 'Someday We'll Look Back On This' (BTS7) and more recently on 'The Lost Soundboard Tape' (from Asbury Records AR16/17/18), and an upgraded 'Hussey Remaster'. The complete audience recording, including "Quarter To Three" was released as part of the 'DS Archives Volume 21'.

1978-09-19 - CAPITOL THEATRE, PASSAIC, NJ

BADLANDS / STREETS OF FIRE / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN INDEPENDENCE DAY / THE PROMISED LAND / PROVE IT ALL NIGHT / RACING IN THE STREET / THUNDER ROAD / MEETING ACROSS THE RIVER / JUNGLELAND / KITTY'S BACK / FIRE / CANDY'S ROOM / BECAUSE THE NIGHT / POINT BLANK / NOT FADE AWAY - SHE'S THE ONE / BACKSTREETS / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) / BORN TO RUN / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT / DETROIT MEDLEY / RAISE YOUR HAND (4.22)

Radio broadcast, soundboard tapes (all three nights in Passaic were recorded by the Record Plant's mobile unit, both on multi-track and live-to-two track) and professionally shot in-house black and white video. Probably one of the best all-time concert recordings. Broadcast on WNEW-FM New York and nine other stations in the north-east, including WBCN-FM and WCOZ-FM Boston, WIOQ-FM Philadelphia and WIYY-FM Baltimore. Set includes great versions of "Because The Night" and "Fire," and also includes what many consider to be the finest examples of "Racing In The Street" and "Thunder Road" ever. Essential. Also, video footage is available. A short live excerpt from this show (Bruce's band introduction during "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)") was officially - and exclusively - released on a promotion-only 7" flexidisc issued to subscribers of Austrian pop magazine "Rennbahn Express" in June 1981. Following the show, WBCN-TV news reporter Felipe Luciano interviews Bruce. Released on CDs 'Piece De Resistance' (Great Dane), 'Southside Bruce And The E Street Jukes' (Seagull), 'USA 1978' (Arriba), 'Passaic Night' (Crystal Cat) and 'Passaic Night' (Scorpio). Also available on CDR 'The Way It Was - September 19th'; a direct transfer of the radio broadcast and includes all the station breaks, chat and interviews as they were heard on WNEW. Released to retail in 2014 on CD 'Capitol Theater, Passaic, NJ, September 19th, 1978' (Klondike) and in February 2015 on CD 'Passaic Night' (Leftfield Media). Neither of these are official releases or sonic upgrades over other versions.

All of the concert now circulate on an average-to-poor quality DVD, although a recently enhanced two-DVD version has been released, which is worth getting. Unfortunately the last hour of the DVD only circulates with a VCR generated "timecode" on-screen display, which obstructs and distracts. This footage without the timecode does however circulate amongst private collectors. That TV report by New York's "Channel 4 News," which includes partial, pro-shot colour footage of three songs from this show ("Badlands," "Spirit In The Night" and "Born To Run") and a short backstage interview, is circulating on fan-made DVDs. A full copy of the programme can be downloaded here. (right click, save as, 6mb).

1978-09-20 - CAPITOL THEATRE, PASSAIC, NJ

Soundcheck: WEDDING BELLS / THE TIES THAT BIND (instrumental warm up + full take) / GOOD ROCKIN' TONIGHT / (piano instrumental) THUNDER ROAD (instrumental) / I'M ALIVE / (guitar instrumental) WHOLE LOTTA LOVE (instrumental) / DON'T BE CRUEL (vocal ad-lib) / I CAN'T HELP IT (IF I'M STILL IN LOVE WITH YOU) / GUESS THINGS HAPPEN THAT WAY (two takes) HEY PORTER (vocal ad-lib) / I WALK THE LINE / (I HEARD THAT) LONESOME WHISTLE / (piano instrumental) / GO AWAY (COME CLOSE) (several takes) / HIGH SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL / GO AWAY (COME CLOSE) (instrumental) / POINT BLANK (instrumental) / KITTY'S BACK (instrumental)

Fascinating soundcheck taped from outside the venue. In the middle of a three-night stand at the Capitol, Bruce works through several Hank Williams and Johnny Cash classics, tackles the 1964 Hollies single "I'm Alive," Led Zeppelin's "Whole Lotta Love" and addresses new material as well. "Go Away (Come Close)" is a moody, minor key ballad, either newly written or from the Darkness album sessions. Another one that got away. Meanwhile, "The Ties That Bind" may well be the band's first performance, as Bruce carefully reviews chord changes before they try it out. The raw, edgy arrangement is very different from the Searchers-styled rendition Springsteen would debut in concert in November, being more like Jeff Beck-era Yardbirds, a la "You're A Better Man Than I". The careful arrangement of "Wedding Bells" is stark and moving, with slower versions approaching the mood Bruce would later achieve with "Used Cars" on 1982's Nebraska.

These recordings all likely derive from this one soundcheck. Previously Brucebase has placed this soundcheck session under September 19, with the reasoning that there would be no need to do a soundcheck before the second night of the stand since Bruce carried his own sound crew on the road. However, it seems unlikely that Springsteen would carry out a soundcheck with such experimental content prior to an important radio broadcast. There may have not been a necessity to perform a soundcheck in the middle of a three night stand, but that doesn't mean that Springsteen wouldn't use the opportunity to work on new material. In addition, the soundcheck has historically been considered to have taken place on this date (prior to Brucebase listing the soundcheck on September 19, we had it listed here, on September 20). Finally, during "Point Blank" Bruce can be heard referring to something that happened in the song "last night"; there was no concert on September 18.

Audience tape and partial in-line video with soundboard audio. Complete show available on pro-shot video, soundboard audio sourced from the video feed and a 2011 transfer of a two-track recording recorded by the Record Plant's mobile unit. "It's My Life" played by request from the crowd. Listen after "It's My Life" for Roy starting the intro to "Racing In The Street," but Bruce deciding to skip it and go right into "Thunder Road." First "Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town" of the tour, last played in December 1975. Debut of the extended instrumental introduction to "Point Blank". Early 2012 saw new audio and video sources of this show emerge; 'Douceur de Vivre' (JEMS) (translates as 'the sweetness of life') is possibly one of the best quality recordings of Springsteen in existence (both official and unofficial) and is a must for any collector. This tape does not have the cuts to "Jungleland" and "Incident On 57th Street", but does lack the start of "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out" and the end of "Twist And Shout". 'Douceur de Vivre' uses patches from the video source to fill in the missing parts. Subsequent to the JEMS version, Godfather released a copy on CD 'Second Night At The Capitol Theatre'. Also available on CDs '2nd Night At The Capitol Theatre' (Winged Wheel) and 'Tonight It's Just You And Me', both of which use the old line video as source. The soundcheck (Unbooted) can be found on CD 'Capitol Soundcheck' from Great Dane.

The concert was professionally filmed on the Capitol Theatre's in-house video system. The resulting film is technically lacking, but very well shot with excellent direction. The two-DVD 'Live In Passaic - September 20th 1978' from Brucevideos uses a recently unearthed video source, and is a substantial visual upgrade over the existing sources. This DVD uses the JEMS audio. All video sources are missing the start of "Jungleland" and thirty seconds of "Incident On 57th Street" due to tape changes. Part of the soundcheck (including takes of "Wedding Bells" and "The Ties That Bind") also circulates on video. The first three songs listed above, plus segments of "Point Blank" and "Kitty's Back," circulate on DVD from an excellent in-line source.

HIGH SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL / BADLANDS / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN / SWEET LITTLE SIXTEEN / INDEPENDENCE DAY / THE PROMISED LAND / PROVE IT ALL NIGHT / RACING IN THE STREET / THUNDER ROAD / MEETING ACROSS THE RIVER / JUNGLELAND / SANTA CLAUS IS COMIN' TO TOWN / FIRE / CANDY'S ROOM / BECAUSE THE NIGHT / POINT BLANK / KITTY'S BACK / THE FEVER / INCIDENT ON 57TH STREET / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / BORN TO RUN / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT / QUARTER TO THREE

Final night of three at the Capitol Theatre opens with "High School Confidential". Springsteen introduces "Sweet Little Sixteen" (played for the seventh and last time this tour) as "a birthday song to myself". Bruce messes up "Racing In The Street", forgetting the lyrics. He later asks the crowd to choose between "The Fever" and "Incident On 57th Street", and the resulting cheers are so close he plays both. Particular highlight is the seven song stretch after "Fire", including a rare transition from "Incident On 57th Street" into "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)". The latter features an instrumental snippet of "Macho Man" after Clarence's introduction. There was no scheduled show for Springsteen’s birthday on September 23, so they celebrated it at this gig – and, to his amazement, Bruce receives a very unique birthday cake onstage, courtesy of the band and crew. See it for yourself by clicking the date/location link above.

Soundboard tape. As with the first two nights in Passaic, the concert was recorded by the Record Plant's mobile unit, both on multi-track and live-to-two track. It is assumed that the show was also filmed on the in-house video system, but no footage has ever emerged. Released on CD 'The Bosses Birthday Party' (BS) and re-issued in 2004 as 'Singin' Our Birthday Songs' (Godfather). Early in 2012 an upgraded version of the soundboard was released, sourced from the master live-to-two track soundboard reels. The quality is similar to the previous night, if perhaps not with the same level of clarity. This recording includes the entire "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out and "Quarter To Three", both of which are missing from the old tapes and is available as 'Coup de Grace' (JEMS/Hoserama). Billboard reported that a total of 10,518 tickets were sold for the three nights at the Capitol Theatre, and gross receipts of $85,791.

1978-09-23 - BOARDWALK, ASBURY PARK, NJ

On his 29th birthday Bruce travels to Asbury Park for an interview with Mike Greenblatt of The Aquarian and photographer Bob Sorce. They wait for him on the boardwalk near The Casino until he turns up some time after 1:30pm, having just got up. After lunch at the Convention Hall Coffee Shop, they move on to the beach before Bruce drives to Freehold and other towns in the area, taking in locations like The Upstage and Tinker West's surfboard factory. The interview was re-produced in Backstreets #31 from Winter 1990.

1978-09-25 - BOSTON GARDEN, BOSTON, MA

GOOD ROCKIN’ TONIGHT / BADLANDS / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN / INDEPENDENCE DAY / THE PROMISED LAND / PROVE IT ALL NIGHT / RACING IN THE STREET / THUNDER ROAD / JUNGLELAND / SANTA CLAUS IS COMIN' TO TOWN / FIRE / CANDY'S ROOM / BECAUSE THE NIGHT / POINT BLANK / NOT FADE AWAY - SHE’S THE ONE / INCIDENT ON 57TH STREET / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / BORN TO RUN / QUARTER TO THREE

Surprisingly, given that Boston contained some of Bruce’s most rabid fan base. The above-mentioned setlist is culled from critic Steve Morse’s review in the Boston Globe. The track listing for the first set is complete and in the correct performance order. Springsteen opened the second set with “Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town”. There are likely two songs from the second set not listed above, as they were not articulated in Morse’s review. (One of these was "Candy's Room"). Morse notes the rarely utilized “New York City Serenade” as being performed at the tail end of the show, although fans present state that it was in fact "Incident On 57th Street" that was played. "Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town" was played because Bruce said he didn't think they would make it back before Christmas time, and "Not Fade Away" - "She's The One" was the choice of the crowd over "Kitty's Back" - Billboard magazine reported an attendance of 11,000 (a sellout) and gross receipts of $102,707.

There is no known audio from this show.

The gig contains the only known Springsteen performance of James Brown's “Night Train” (while the stage is cleared of the fake snow that fell during "Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town"), and stand-out renditions of "Independence Day" and "Backstreets". Billboard magazine reported an attendance of 3,828 (a sellout) and gross receipts of $32,538.

Regional live FM broadcast simulcast by about twenty radio stations throughout the south-eastern United States. This was a make-up show that had originally been slated for July 23, but which had been postponed (along with three others) due to Bruce coming down with a throat infection. On the audio Bruce can be heard apologizing for being sick and missing the original date. Excellent radio broadcast released on CD 'Fox Theatre Presents The Boss' (PPL), 'Here's To Ya, Pts 1, 2 & 3' (Turtle Records) and in best quality as 'Same Old Played Out Scenes' (Doberman). In August 2011 a pre-FM recording titled 'The Fox' (JEMS) emerged - a major upgrade over the FM broadcasts. Unfortunately this recording is incomplete, missing the encores, around six minutes of "Prove It All Night", and the start of "Racing In The Street". On the flip-side "Backstreets" is now complete, and several spoken segments are no longer missing. The quality of this recording is peerless, and an essential listen. This upgrade is also available on three-CD set 'The Definitive Atlanta' (Masterpiece), 'Night Train To Georgia' (Vintage Masters) and 'Everybody's Rockin' Tonight' from Godfather.

Premiere of the Rolling Stones' "The Last Time" (one of only three known versions outside of clubs), the last known "It's My Life" and the last "Kitty's Back" of the tour. The latter will not be played again until the Christmas show of December 17, 2000. The nearly complete second set above is courtesy of an attendee who had the forethought to make a note of the setlist. The song after "For You" was written as a question mark - it's quite likely to be "Fire". A fan present recalls "The second night was added after the re-scheduling and so has the correct date. That's the second show I went to that year and it remains my holy grail of live tapes. The one song I know for sure that's not listed is "Incident On 57th Street" segueing into "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)", as on The Wild, The Innocent & The E Street Shuffle. "Quarter to Three" returned in place of "Raise Your Hand". I remember it being a longer show than the Saturday show". A contributor to the Greasy Lake website recalls "it included the early version of "Point Blank" and ended with "Kitty's Back", "Incident On 57th Street" and "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" with the album piano coda linking both songs. For the second encore he played "Raise Your Hand" and an extremely high energy "Quarter To Three" that ended with Bruce standing on Roy's piano and ripping his shirt off before leaping off and dancing off stage as Miami Steve directed the band to the finish." It has been suggested that the show included "New York City Serenade" - given the evidence we have it's certain that "New York City Serenade" was NOT played. Billboard magazine reported an attendance of 3,822 (a sellout) and gross receipts of $32,487.

Incomplete audience tape (Unbooted) of the first set only (up to "Jungleland"). There is no known audio of the second set.

1978-10-17 - THE TROUBADOUR, WEST HOLLYWOOD, CA

MONA / NOT FADE AWAY

With The Knack. Bruce apparently went on to jam with the band later that night and may have given them the impetus to later record "Don't Look Back". Some tape exists of this late night session with Bruce teaching The Knack's drummer Bruce Gary how to play "Rendezvous" at his hotel room at The Sunset Marquis.

Audience tape. Available on CD 'Ultra Rare Trax Vol 1' (Mosquito).

1978-10-26 - SPRINGSTEEN RESIDENCE, HOLMDEL, NJ

THE TIES THAT BIND / THE TIES THAT BIND / THE TIES THAT BIND / TONIGHT / TONIGHT / TONIGHT / TONIGHT / TONIGHT / TONIGHT / WILD KISSES (I’M GONNA TREAT YOU RIGHT)

After a month’s break in the Darkness Tour, and a few days away from the start of the final tour leg, Bruce convenes a band rehearsal in a converted barn on his farmhouse property on Telegraph Hill Road in Holmdel, NJ. This barn, which Bruce had been using for band rehearsals since mid-1976, was nicknamed the “Telegraph Hill Studio”, although in reality it was not a studio - there were no high level room acoustics or recording facilities.

The rehearsal itself would have lasted much longer, so the known audio likely represents only a part of the session. The audio includes three takes of “The Ties That Bind”, six takes of “Tonight”, one take of the Buddy Holly-ish “I’m Gonna Treat You Right (Wild Kisses)”. As it turned out, “The Ties That Bind” made its public live debut at Princeton a few days later. The well-known rehearsal take of "Janey Needs A Shooter" was previously listed here actually dates from May 1979, please see The River - Studio Sessions page for details on this track.

The above-mentioned partial setlist (the actual performing order is not known) is culled from very crudely recorded audio that is believed to emanate from this October 1978 rehearsal. Unfortunately the sound quality is not good and Springsteen’s vocals are buried beneath the instruments. All this audio has been in circulation since 1984 (originally among only a few people in cassette form). However the audio seems to have quickly been broken up into individual tracks and didn’t circulate complete. This material then soon trickled into the hands of vinyl bootleggers and within 15 months all the material had appeared on various different (vinyl) bootlegs – most of it misidentified.

The 1984-1994 history of this rehearsal audio from cassette tape (just a few collectors) to vinyl (a limited group of collectors) to CD (a very wide group of collectors) warrants elaboration here. “Wild Kisses” first appeared in mid-1985 as a bonus 7” single in the very rare colored vinyl edition of the ten-LP box set ‘All Those Years' (SC Records). Soon afterwards, in early 1986, both “Wild Kisses” plus one of the takes of “Tonight” appeared on the scarce four-LP set ‘Studio Collection' (Babel Records). In mid-1986 one of the takes of “Ties That Bind” and another take of “Tonight” appeared on the vinyl LP boot ‘Fever' (Backstreets Records). Finally, in early 1987 all of the audio appeared on the extremely rare vinyl LP boot “At Home' (Rock Records). However due to the scarcity of these (above noted) vinyl bootleg titles this rehearsal audio was not well known in the collector community until it appeared in the 1990s on widely distributed CD format bootlegs. This material is often listed as emanating from the Darkness On The Edge Of Town studio sessions – however the audio dynamics are clearly from a rehearsal location, not a studio environment. All this audio became widely known when it appeared on the big-selling 1990s era CD boot 'Unsurpassed Springsteen Vol 6' (Yellow Dog).

First show of the final leg of the Darkness Tour. Premiere of "The Ties That Bind". A reader present comments "I rank this as one of the all-time greatest Bruce concerts (of the 50+ I have attended and I know I’m just a piker on that standard). The audience jumping and dancing caused the gym floor to vibrate and move up and down". A contributor to the Greasy Lake website also recalls "Amidst the madness, I recall that the Jadwin gym floor was oscillating wildly - from our seats in the north stands it looked like the folks on the floor were standing on the surface of the ocean, rocked by waves". The “urban legend” is that this concert caused structural damage to the facility and that this was the last major rock concert to take place in Jadwin Gym. An article in the college newspaper The Daily Princetonian from November 7 does report damage to the surface of the basketball court (mainly caused by chair legs gouging holes in the hardwood floor), but nothing more substantial, even in the weeks and months after the concert.

The first-ever rock concert at Cornell with a reserved seating policy. The twenty song setlist (above) is the complete show. Bruce sings a snippet of "I'm A Roadrunner" in the introduction to "Darkness On The Edge Of Town". “Fire” opens the second set. First known show to include "I Get Mad" in "She's The One". Confusion reigns on the day of the show when a band of merry pranksters went around campus posting leaflets announcing the concert had been cancelled. It hadn’t.

There is some debate as to the identity of the opening song. The St. Bonaventure 1979 yearbook states that "Badlands" opened, but we have several independent reports that it was, in fact, "Good Rockin' Tonight". "Streets Of Fire" probably follows "Badlands", and the fourth song is "Spirit In The Night" with Bruce out amongst the audience. It's missing from the tape, but in all likelihood "Backstreets" followed "She's The One". Set features a rare performance of "Louie Louie". "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes the "Come A Little Bit Closer" introduction. The show was featured in an article in the school newspaper, titled "Kinetic Springsteen Rocks RC".

Incomplete audience tape (starts at "Independence Day") with speed fluctuations.

Set features the only known inclusion of Little Richard's "Lucille" in "Detroit Medley".

Audience tape missing two songs that were likely played: "Backstreets" and "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)". Average quality and seems to run a little fast.

1978-12-05 - LSU ASSEMBLY CENTER, LOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY, BATON ROUGE, LA

BADLANDS / STREETS OF FIRE / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN / INDEPENDENCE DAY / THE PROMISED LAND / PROVE IT ALL NIGHT / RACING IN THE STREET / THUNDER ROAD / JUNGLELAND / THE TIES THAT BIND / SANTA CLAUS IS COMIN' TO TOWN / FIRE / CANDY'S ROOM / BECAUSE THE NIGHT / POINT BLANK / MONA - SHE'S THE ONE - I GET MAD / BACKSTREETS / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / BORN TO RUN / DETROIT MEDLEY / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT / QUARTER TO THREE

The above-mentioned setlist is from a fan recollection that is deemed reliable. The majority of this recollection is confirmed via a handwritten list noted on the back of a ticket by a fan that attended the show. The list seems to be missing a few songs, particularly from the start of the second set. Billboard reports ticket sales of 5,337 (a sellout) and gross receipts of $40,027.

There is no known audio from this show.

Bruce messes up the lyrics to "Thunder Road". Set features a new style to the introduction of "She's The One" with the inclusion of "Preacher's Daughter" for the first time - this is a regular for the next few shows. Show also includes "The Fever". Setlist pieced together from tape and news article sources. Click the date/location link above for the articles and pictures.

1978-12-08 - THE SUMMIT, HOUSTON, TX

BADLANDS / STREETS OF FIRE / IT'S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY / DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / INDEPENDENCE DAY / THE PROMISED LAND / PROVE IT ALL NIGHT / RACING IN THE STREET / THUNDER ROAD / JUNGLELAND / THE TIES THAT BIND / SANTA CLAUS IS COMIN' TO TOWN / THE FEVER / FIRE / CANDY'S ROOM / BECAUSE THE NIGHT / POINT BLANK / MONA - PREACHER'S DAUGHTER - SHE'S THE ONE - I GET MAD / BACKSTREETS / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / BORN TO RUN / DETROIT MEDLEY / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT / YOU CAN'T SIT DOWN / QUARTER TO THREE

The show is recorded on the in-house video system, and is officially released on DVD and Blu-ray on the Darkness On The Edge Of Town deluxe box-set in November 2010. "Quarter To Three" is missing from the circulating audience tape but is included (unfortunately edited) on the official DVD. The video showcases stand-out versions of many songs, including a searing "Streets Of Fire", "Prove It All Night" (with one of the longest introductions of the entire tour) and Texas-favourite "The Fever" with some great interplay between Danny and Clarence. "It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City" is dedicated to "all the folks from the Liberty Hall days," referring to Bruce's shows at the famous Houston venue in 1974. The 100th show of the tour, and one of the few Darkness concerts that does not include the full 'Sad Eyes' sequence in "Backstreets". The DVD also lacks a fair amount of the between-song chat, presumably due to cuts on the original recording. "Racing In The Street" is edited, with the end of the coda apparently patched in from another date. Set includes good versions of "Because The Night" and "Point Blank" - watch for Clarence missing his cue during the former, and Bruce's subsequent reaction. Billboard reports ticket sales of 12,003 (a sellout) and gross receipts of $98,925.

Incomplete audience tape (missing the final track) and mostly complete in-house video.

1978-12-11 - UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO, BOULDER, CO

Cancelled (prior to any local promotion or tickets going on sale), never rescheduled. This gig is noted on CBS’s tour itinerary files - yet the University’s Archives Department has researched the matter for Brucebase and reports that no Springsteen concert took place, or was even pre-advertised.

Prior to the show, Bruce conducts a ten-minute interview with KSAN Radio, which is broadcast in the interval of the December 15 show.

Audience tape. The available recording runs fast throughout much of the show, the last two songs are marred by pitch issues likely due to the tapers batteries dying, "Prove It All Night" intro is cut and "Quarter To Three" end is cut. No full 'Sad Eyes' interlude in "Backstreets".

1978-12-15 - WINTERLAND BALLROOM, SAN FRANCISCO, CA

BADLANDS / STREETS OF FIRE / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN / FACTORY / THE PROMISED LAND / PROVE IT ALL NIGHT / RACING IN THE STREET / THUNDER ROAD / JUNGLELAND / THE TIES THAT BIND / SANTA CLAUS IS COMIN' TO TOWN / THE FEVER / FIRE / CANDY'S ROOM / BECAUSE THE NIGHT / POINT BLANK / MONA - PREACHER'S DAUGHTER - SHE'S THE ONE - I GET MAD / BACKSTREETS / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / BORN TO RUN / DETROIT MEDLEY / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT / RAISE YOUR HAND / QUARTER TO THREE / TWIST AND SHOUT

A review of the show by Joel Selvin was printed in the San Francisco Chronicle - click the above link to read it.

FM Broadcast (KSAN radio) and soundboard tapes - this is a master reel recording and includes three tracks not broadcast. What can you say! The versions of "The Promised Land" and "Prove It All Night" are exceptional and "Backstreets" is better than that. Probably the most famous show Bruce will ever do. It should be noted that the source tape appears to run slightly slow. Released on CDs 'Live At Winterland' (Golden Stars), 'Live In The Promised Land' (Great Dane Records), 'Winterland Night' (Crystal Cat) and most recently (and in best quality) on CDR 'Prodigal Son at Winterland - 25th Anniversary Remaster' (Prodigal Son). This is a remaster of 'Winterland Night'. Also released to retail in 2014 under the title 'Winterland 15th December 1978' (Echoes). This is not an official release nor a sonic upgrade over previous versions. Tonight's show (and potentially the next night) may have been filmed on the Winterland's in-house video system. However, no concrete evidence has ever emerged that indicate this is the case. Certainly there is plenty of video of other artists from around the same time, but the most likely scenario is that any film was lost in a fire at Bill Graham's San Francisco warehouse offices in 1985. It is possible that a copy may still reside in Springsteen's vaults.

On listening to Crystal Cat's 'Winterland Night' and several other releases, it's clear that the recording of "Quarter To Three" is from a different source to the rest of the concert. For some time it's been assumed that this recording is from a different date entirely. However, a review of the concert in the Stanford Daily goes into some detail about Springsteen's performance of "Quarter To Three" and the author's description is a excellent match for the soundboard recording, including of Bruce pausing at one point to state "I think I'm going to throw up", repeated verbatim on the soundboard. While night on night there tends to be some repetition in Springsteen's shtick, this particular statement appears to be unique to tonight's show. Therefore, we can state with very high confidence that the soundboard recording is from this concert. The identity of the final song has been the topic of heated debate over the years, one fan present says "It looked like the show was over. The band was gone. But no one else would leave. The place - I guess about 5000 in festival seating, actually standing - was just roaring, going nuts. Bruuuuce, on and on. Finally he came back alone, and the band finally trickled out and Bruce said, "We're off the radio now, but I'll do one more for you guys. This is the first song I ever learned to play on the guitar," and then "Twist and Shout". A great version, too. He was standing on speakers ten feet off the floor. I was there and I'd stake my life on it." However, others are just as insistent that the final song was "Quarter To Three", and other concerts around this time all have "Quarter To Three" as the final song, which supports this view. There is an interview with photographer P.J. Plutzer in Backstreets magazine #49 (Spring 1995), and he clearly states that "Quarter To Three" was the final encore. Plutzer shot some forty shows between 1975-84 including both Winterland gigs. Given the evidence, it is feasible (and perhaps most likely) that Springsteen left the stage after "Quarter To Three" and returned some minutes later (perhaps up to fifteen or twenty, maybe more) to perform "Twist And Shout" in front of those who remained, as he did in Seattle five days later. Perhaps those who are certain that "Quarter To Three" was the final song left the venue, and were unaware of Springsteen's return to the stage.

Tour premiere of "Rendezvous", which Bruce dedicated to Greg Kihn. Bruce forgets the words to "Racing In The Street". Billboard magazine reported a total attendance of 10,800 for the two shows at Winterland (both sold-out) and gross receipts of $80,975.

Audience tape and partial soundboard. Available on CDRs 'Winterland: The Second Night' and 'A Night In Heaven'. Audio recording of “Fire” from this show was officially released on the Live 1975-85 box set, although preceded by a short spoken intro that actually originates from the Roxy show on July 7. Soundboard recordings of "Thunder Road", "Jungleland", and "Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town" circulate on CD 'Live 1975-88' (Orange Records), while "It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City" can be found on CD '85-75 The Outtakes' (Catch 22).

This concert was re-scheduled from December 18.

Audience tape of exceptional quality. Released on CD 'Paramount Night' (Crystal Cat). Also available from the master cassettes (by Pat Lee), although Paramount Night is slightly better with more punch, to this writer anyway. The sound quality of the first set is remarkable. Unfortunately it decreases somewhat during "Jungleland", and never really recovers to previous levels.

1978-12-20 - SEATTLE CENTER ARENA, SEATTLE, WA

Famous concert when Bruce returned to the stage after the house lights went on to perform the last two numbers to a stunned remaining few. Excellent show includes the first version of "Pretty Flamingo" since the '75 tour. No "I Get Mad" in "She's The One", it's replaced by "Gloria".

Audience tape. Released on CDs 'Pretty Flamingo' (BM), 'This Is For The Crazies' (Anubis) and in superior quality as 'Seattle, Ho Ho Ho' (16Bit & 24Bit) (Ev2) from the master reels. This transfer includes the flawed "Badlands" and "Streets Of Fire", and can also be found on CDR 'Seattle Master Reels' (Masterpiece).

"Backstreets" was not played at this show. According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette the 7,000 tickets for two nights at the Stanley Theatre sold out faster than any other concert in recent memory. The article also mentions that "Adam Raised A Cain" was performed, but this can't be verified by the audience tape. If true it would be a rarity - it hadn't been played for some three months. Click the link above to read the full review.

Audience tape. Newly available on a remastered CDR 'Lights Out Tonight' which gets it's name from not only the first line of "Badlands", but also from "Point Blank", when Bruce sings "…one false move and baby the lights go out." At that point in this show they did kill the stage lights. The taper was sitting near to the sound and light board and in the darkness one of the techs knocked his clipboard onto the floor, which can be heard on the tape.

First known version of "Ramrod", played in an arrangement that's not all that different from all later versions. There are clear variations in the lyrics, however. Audio of "Ramrod" can be heard by clicking on the date/location link above. Set also includes "4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)" in an unusual slot in the first set, and "Not Fade Away" returns to the "She's The One" medley after nearly two months. Billboard magazine reported total ticket sales of 6,962 for the two shows at Stanley Theatre (both sold-out) and gross receipts of $58,270.

A report from a fan present has "Twist And Shout" played with the house lights on at the end of the show, a recollection that is confirmed by another attendee. It's not on any audio available though.

Audience tape available as 'Celebrating Early' (JEMS Archive) transferred from a first generation tape and released in early 2013. This is an upgrade over the already circulating 'A One Night For Year's End'.

The penultimate show of the tour includes great versions of "Jungleland" and "The Fever" and the last known "Pretty Flamingo" (until 2003). This is the famous "Firecracker show" where someone threw one on stage which hit Bruce, provoking a rant from Steve Van Zandt. During the next tour Bruce would regularly ask people not to let off firecrackers.

Soundboard (which has none of the encores) and audience tapes. Sound is good. The soundboard portion is available on CD 'The Firecracker Show' (Moonlight). The audience tape (Unbooted) covers the encores, but cuts during "Quarter To Three". The soundboard and audience tape have been combined to form the complete show, available as 'The Firecracker Night' (Earlmv).

Last night of the tour, and a 31-song setlist, the longest of the tour. Last "Streets Of Fire" until 2003, "Meeting Across The River" until 1999, "The Fever" until 1999, and the last E Street Band "Heartbreak Hotel". Rare performances of "I Fought The Law" and "The Last Time". Unusually for the tour, "Spirit In The Night" includes the "Stagger Lee" introduction.

Audience tape (Unbooted) and partial soundboard - what a show! Two recording sources are known to exist, released on CDR 'Final Darkness Night'. "The Last Time" featured on the LP 'Rockin' Days' is from a different recording source. Audience tape also available on CD 'Meeting Across The River' (I Had A Dream Records) but it is unknown which source this uses, while the partial five song soundboard is available as bonus tracks on CD 'Raising Cain' (E Street Records). Crystal Cat's 'Passaic Night' also includes "For You" and "It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City" as bonus tracks. Soundboard tape covers the first five tracks from the second set.

1979-01-11 - LOCK STOCK AND BARREL, FAIR HAVEN, NJ

MOUNTAIN OF LOVE / MUSTANG SALLY / KANSAS CITY / I SAW HER STANDING THERE / ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC / QUARTER TO THREE / TWIST AND SHOUT / HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU

A private 37th birthday party for Clarence Clemons, with Springsteen and the entire E Street Band (except for Steve Van Zandt) attending and performing a rollicking set of classics for the invitation-only gathering of close friends and family. Clarence’s pre-E Street band compatriot, Norman Seldin, was playing an extended residency at the club at the time and both Clarence and Garry Tallent had made guest appearances with Seldin at the club the previous week. The above-mentioned setlist is incomplete and not necessarily in the correct performing sequence – there were many other songs performed, although no Springsteen compositions. Apparently Bruce took the lead or co-lead vocal on the above titles.

1979-03-00 - WARREN ZEVON’S HOUSE, LOS ANGELES, CA

JEANNIE NEEDS A SHOOTER

Bruce gets together with Warren Zevon for a brief, one-off, writing session. According to Zevon’s 1980 comments to Rolling Stone, he’d heard through the grapevine about the unreleased Springsteen song “Jamie [sic] Needs A Shooter”, was highly intrigued by its title, but had never heard any demo. Zevon indicated he composed the new melody for the Springsteen-Zevon re-write, as well as the first verse of lyrics. Springsteen contributed most of the lyrics to the other three verses, as well as the refrain lyrics. Zevon recorded this re-written version a couple of months later in Los Angeles (Bruce was not involved in the studio session) and this recording was issued on Zevon’s Bad Luck Streak In Dancing School album in January 1980.

1979-03-25 - THE FAST LANE, ASBURY PARK, NJ

Springsteen attends a show by the Ramones. Although he doesn't join them onstage he spends some time with the group backstage, apparently sitting and harmonizing a few songs with Joey Ramone, who half-jokingly asks Bruce to write them a song – Bruce goes home that evening and begins to write what turns out to be “Hungry Heart”, although he ultimately decides (upon recommendation of Jon Landau) to keep the song for his own use.

Wedding of Marc Brickman to June Rudley, Bruce's lighting director and travel agent respectively. Springsteen and members of the band join Rickie Lee Jones and Boz Scaggs for a three hour celebration at West Hollywood's Whisky a Go Go on Sunset Blvd. They play for three hours, a mixture of classic covers and Springsteen originals. Covers include Ernie K-Doe's 1961 #1 hit "Mother-in-Law", The Everly Brothers' "All I Have To Do Is Dream" and Larry Williams' "Slow Down", which was also recorded by The Beatles on their Long Tall Sally EP in 1964.

PROVE IT ALL NIGHT / BADLANDS / THE PROMISED LAND / THE RIVER / SHERRY DARLING / THUNDER ROAD / JUNGLELAND / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / BORN TO RUN / STAY (with Jackson Browne and Rosemary Butler) / DETROIT MEDLEY / RAVE ON

First of two MUSE (Musicians United for Safe Energy) Benefit concerts, also known as "No Nukes". Twelve song set includes the premiere of "The River". The crowd sings "Happy Birthday" to Bruce before "Thunder Road".

Soundboard tape. Outstanding video footage of "The River" is included in the 1980 theatrical movie release No Nukes (later available on home video) and also the official Video Anthology DVD. Audio recordings of "Stay" (with Jackson Browne and Rosemary Butler) and an edited "Devil With The Blue Dress Medley" (a.k.a. "Detroit Medley") were officially released on Elektra/Asylum’s three-LP concert album No Nukes later that year (which was eventually officially issued on a two-CD set in 1997).

1979-09-22 - MADISON SQUARE GARDEN, NEW YORK CITY, NY

PROVE IT ALL NIGHT / BADLANDS / THE PROMISED LAND / THE RIVER / SHERRY DARLING / THUNDER ROAD / JUNGLELAND / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / BORN TO RUN / STAY (with Jackson Browne, Tom Petty, and Rosemary Butler) / QUARTER TO THREE

Second MUSE (Musicians United for Safe Energy) Benefit concert, also known as "No Nukes". "Summertime Blues" has been reported as being played but there is no evidence of this. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" features an instrumental snippet of the "Batman Theme" after Max's introduction. Contains the infamous Lynn Goldsmith moment during "Quarter To Three" - Goldsmith (Bruce's ex-girlfriend) was taking photos, which Bruce thought she had agreed not to do. He drags her up on stage, announces her as "my ex-girlfriend" and then has her escorted away. Tom Petty joins along with Jackson Browne and Rosemary Butler for "Stay".

Soundboard, audience tapes and some video. Soundboard available on CDs 'The Complete MUSE shows', 'No Nukes' (Godfatherecords) and 'Two Nights In The Garden' (Vintage Masters). Outstanding video footage of "Thunder Road" and the finale of "Quarter To Three" is included in the 1980 theatrical movie release No Nukes, later available on home video. "Thunder Road" is also included on the Video Anthology VHS/DVD. Unreleased, pro-shot raw film footage of the complete “Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)” from this show is circulating on fan-made DVDs, as is a longer (but still edited) version of "Quarter To Three" with the Lynn Goldsmith "incident" removed. Thirteen minutes of outstanding semi-professional video of three songs, "Prove It All Night", "Badlands", and "The Promised Land" also circulates.

1979-10-05 - THE FAST LANE, ASBURY PARK, NJ

ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / AIN'T THAT A SHAME / TWIST AND SHOUT

Springsteen makes a surprise appearance at The Fast Lane (actually early in the morning of October 6), playing with Beaver Brown, Vini Lopez, and Dave Marsh. Bruce asked Vini (who was working on the fishing boats at the time) if he wanted to play. Despite wearing big fishing boots Vini was never going to say no, and so played in his boots - the first time in over five years that he had shared a stage with Bruce. Springsteen at this time only played oldies or covers when making surprise appearances at clubs, so for him to play an original is very unusual. Springsteen called Dave Marsh up on stage ("let's bring up the Duke"), and he jumped around at the front of the stage with a tambourine.

Audience tape (Unbooted) of poor quality (missing "Ain't That A Shame").

1979-10-06 - THE FAST LANE, ASBURY PARK, NJ

TWIST AND SHOUT

Bruce jumps on stage at an Ellen Shipley gig at The Fast Lane. Ellen herself takes up the story: "I remember it well..... It was my gig and Bruce had come to watch. He stood in the back at the bar trying not to be noticed! At the end of my set, the audience knew Bruce was there and began screaming for him. He jumped up on the stage and we did an unbelievable version of Twist N Shout! Kids stood up on their tables to see us perform with Bruce, breaking them down! I had a blast!"

An audience recording attributed to this concert does circulate, however it actually derives from the previous night. That appearance with Beaver Brown actually took place early in the morning of October 6th, which may explain the confusion.

1979-12-00 - THE POWER STATION, NEW YORK CITY, NY

ENDLESS NIGHT / PARALYZED (?)

Springsteen drops into the studio (the same one where The River sessions are taking place), jams with Graham Parker & The Rumour and ends up recording support vocals on one or both of the two above-mentioned tracks. It is not certain that Springsteen actually sings or plays on "Paralyzed".

Both songs are subsequently released on Parker’s April 1980 album The Up Escalator.

* 1980

1980-01-00 - THE POWER STATION, NEW YORK CITY, NY

Springsteen drops by to chat and jam a bit with industrial/experimental outfit Suicide (Alan Vega and Martin Rev), who were recording their second album (released in April 1980) with producer Ric Ocasek (leader of The Cars). Apparently nothing from this brief get-together was recorded. In a 1984 interview with Rolling Stone magazine Springsteen later mentions Suicide's "Frankie Teardrop" as "one of the most amazing songs I ever heard". Suicide's song “Dream Baby Dream” would be covered by Springsteen during his 2005 solo tour and a studio recording officially released on 2014's High Hopes.

THE PROMISED LAND

With Atlantic City Expressway, fronted by Jon Bon Jovi (Jon references this night, but not the date, on VH-1 Behind the Music). There's some debate about the songs played - we understand that Springsteen only played about 90 seconds of "The Promised Land".

PERSONALITY CRISIS / LUCILLE

With The David Johansen Group. Johansen is best known as a member of the protopunk New York Dolls. "Personality Crisis" is the lead song from the New York Dolls' self-titled debut album, released in August 1973.

THIS LITTLE GIRL / DEDICATION / YOUR LOVE / JOLE BLON

Springsteen and The E Street Band sessions for Gary U.S. Bonds, undertaken in the immediate aftermath of the final sessions for The River. Bruce contributed guitar, vocals and co-produced (with Van Zandt) the four above-mentioned tracks, the first three of which are Springsteen compositions.

The four recordings were released on Bonds’ Dedication album in April 1981.

1980-09-00 - CLAIR BROTHERS AUDIO, LITITZ, PA

Friday rehearsal includes: CADILLAC RANCH / SHERRY DARLING / FIRE / CRUSH ON YOU / I WANNA MARRY YOU / RAMROD / POINT BLANK

Saturday rehearsal includes: BORN TO RUN / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT / THE TIES THAT BIND / THE PROMISED LAND

Bootleg video footage: BORN TO RUN / PROVE IT ALL NIGHT / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT / OUT IN THE STREET / THE RIVER (#1) / THE RIVER (#2) / DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN / WRECK ON THE HIGHWAY / THE TIES THAT BIND / THE PROMISED LAND / THUNDER ROAD / RACING IN THE STREET / CADILLAC RANCH (#1) / CADILLAC RANCH (#2) / CADILLAC RANCH (#3) / FIRE (#1) / FIRE (#2) / FIRE (#3)

Rehearsals for the upcoming River Tour over four nights at the end of September. The sessions are extensive, running for up to ten hours a night, starting at 4pm and finishing up as late as past 2am. The exact date of these sessions is uncertain, but students from a college newspaper were present for two nights on a Friday and Saturday, likely to be September 26 and 27. The entire stage was set up in the rehearsal hall, lights and all, just as it will appear on the tour. Roy plays "Once Upon A Time In The West" as a prelude to "The River". The newspaper report also mentions that Bruce, Clarence Clemons and guitar tech Mike Batlan spent time practicing the "Crush On You" guitar toss - click the link above for more details.

Partial soundboard and single camera semi-professional video footage. Some, or all, of these rehearsal sessions were filmed, and extracts of this video footage circulates on a good quality DVD. Audio taken from the video footage available on CD 'Warming Up For The River Tour' and LP 'Rehearsal Sessions 1980 Volume 1 And 2'. The first three songs on the video run into one another, just as they do a few days later on the first night of the tour. Given the set details supplied by students from the Franklin & Marshall College newspaper The College Reporter, it's possible that the video footage is from the Saturday night rehearsal on September 27.

Video footage shot by Barry Rebo of five songs from the rehearsals, "Ramrod", "Cadillac Ranch", "Fire", "Crush On You", and "Sherry Darling" were officially released on December 4, 2015 on The Ties That Bind: The River Collection box-set. This footage is of far higher quality than the static wide shot of the bootleg and was probably shot at the Friday rehearsal on September 26.

Concert includes Bob Seger making a guest appearance on the second version of "Thunder Road" which suffers from distortion. Bruce forgets the words of "Born To Run", which opens a show for the first time. Roy plays "Once Upon A Time In The West" as a prelude to "The River", as he will on and off throughout the tour. Clarence sings the opening lines of "Stagger Lee" as an introduction to "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)". This introduction will feature regularly during the first leg of the tour.

Audience tape available on CDR 'First River Show' and 'The River Tour Opening Night' as well as from a low generation 2012 tape transfer (mjk5510). A further upgrade was released in 2016 via a first generation tape transfer (IvannF/Bickle).

"I Wanna Marry You" features a new introduction, "Here She Comes", which is a variant of the story line used in the past for songs like "Pretty Flamingo".

"Racing In The Street" has an interesting piano introduction. Roy plays "Once Upon A Time In The West" as a prelude to "The River". Clarence sings the opening lines to "Stagger Lee" as an introduction to "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)". Bruce forgets the words during "Jungleland". "Detroit Medley" once again includes "I'm In Love Again", previously played in Chicago on October 10. This appears to be an improvisation using the "I Hear A Train" melody, but if you know the source please get in touch.

In an interview with Dave Marsh, Bruce has told of an evening he spent with a fan during his stay in St Louis. In the interview Springsteen states that he was in Denver, but it appears that his memory was faulty.
"The other night I went out, I went driving, we were in Denver [St. Louis]. Got a car and went out, drove all around. Went to the movies by myself, walked in, got my popcorn. This guy comes up to me, real nice guy. He says, "Listen, you want to sit with me and my sister?" I said, "All right." So we watch the movie (laughs). It was great, too, because it was that Woody Allen movie – [Stardust Memories, released to theatres on September 26, 1980], the guy's slammin' to his fans. And I'm sittin" there and this poor kid says, "Jesus, I don't know what to say to ya. Is this the way it is? Is that how you feel?" I said, "No, I don't feel like that so much." And he had the amazing courage to come up to me at the end of the movie, and ask if I'd go home and meet his mother and father. I said, "What time is it?" It was 11 o'clock, so I said, "Well OK."
So I go home with him; he lives out in some suburb. So we get over to the house and here's his mother and father, laying out on the couch, watching TV and reading the paper. He brings me in and he says, "Hey I got Bruce Springsteen here." And they don't believe him. So he pulls me over, and he says, "This is Bruce Springsteen." "Aw, g'wan," they say. So he runs in his room and brings out an album and he holds it up to my face. And his mother [the infamous "Sophie", who Bruce dedicated "Twist And Shout" to several times, at the top of his lungs, at the August 23, 2008 St. Louis show] says (breathlessly) "Ohhh yeah!" She starts yelling "Yeah," she starts screaming.
And for two hours I was in this kid's house, talking with these people, they were really nice, they cooked me up all this food, watermelon, and the guy gave me a ride home a few hours later.
I felt so good that night. Because here are these strange people I didn't know, they take you in their house, treat you fantastic and this kid was real nice, they were real nice. That is something that can happen to me that can't happen to most people And when it does happen, it's fantastic. You get somebody's whole life in three hours. You get their parents, you get their sister, you get their family life, in three hours. And I went back to that hotel and felt really good because I thought, "Wow (almost whispering), what a thing to be able to do. What an experience to be able to have, to be able to step into some stranger's life."

In April 1988 (around the time that Springsteen was was in town during the Tunnel Of Love Express Tour) a local St Louis TV reporter (John Pertzborn) re-told the story, interviewing Sophie in the process. The TV report (which you can see by clicking the date/location link above) states that the visit took place in January 1981, however we are fairly sure it was actually 1980.

Audience tape of decent quality for the era available on CDR 'St Louis 80', also released as 'Gateway To The Best' (Racing In The Street).

Roy plays "Once Upon A Time In The West" as a prelude to "The River". Bruce starts "Sherry Darling" singing the first verse slow by himself, before the band kicks in to make it the song we know. "Here She Comes" is played as an intro to "I Wanna Marry You", sung by Clarence. Bruce quotes a line from Chuck Berry's "Reelin' And Rockin'" in the intro to "Hungry Heart". The stand-alone "Drive All Night" is also performed live for the first time, and remains a rarity throughout the tour. Clarence sings the opening lines to "Stagger Lee" as an introduction to "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)".

1980-10-23 - OLD TIMERS' CAFÉ, SEATTLE, WA

(GET YOUR KICKS ON) ROUTE 66 / GLORIA / IN THE MIDNIGHT HOUR

In town a day early, Bruce bumps into Phil Hamilton, singer for the Montana-based Lost Highway Band. Due to perform that night at Seattle's Old Timers' Cafe, Hamilton invites Bruce along. That night Springsteen ventures out of the Olympic Hotel alone in the evening, walks a couple of blocks and pays the $1 cover charge to get in and listen to the band. Sat at the end of the bar, Bruce listens to the set before borrowing a guitar and joining the band in a three-song, 15-minute set, although it's not certain that "Gloria" was played. The following night, Springsteen dedicates "The River" to the band.

The second set features ten songs from The River in a row. Roy plays "Once Upon A Time In The West" as a prelude to "The River". Clarence sings the opening lines of "Stagger Lee" as an introduction to "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)". Springsteen dedicates "The River" to the Lost Highway Band, the band that he joined on stage at Seattle's Old Timers' Cafe the previous night.

Audience tape (Unbooted) released as 'That Old '80s Sound' (RS Master via JEMS) and CDR 'Big Boss Man And Big Man' (unknown label). This tape first circulated from the masters in October 2014. The quality of this recording is generally excellent, and ranks as one of the better tapes from the tour. The clarity and separation are particularly noteworthy. Previous versions of this tape are missing four songs; "Cadillac Ranch", "The Ties That Bind", "Wreck On The Highway" and "Raise Your Hand". Bruce's vocals in "Cadillac Ranch" are completely absent from the mix.

PROVE IT ALL NIGHT / OUT IN THE STREET / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT / DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN / FACTORY / INDEPENDENCE DAY / JACKSON CAGE / TWO HEARTS / THE PROMISED LAND / I'M A ROCKER / RACING IN THE STREET / THE RIVER / BADLANDS / THUNDER ROAD / CADILLAC RANCH / FIRE / ON TOP OF OLD SMOKY / SHERRY DARLING / HERE SHE COMES - I WANNA MARRY YOU / THE TIES THAT BIND / WRECK ON THE HIGHWAY / POINT BLANK / CRUSH ON YOU / RAMROD / YOU CAN LOOK (BUT YOU BETTER NOT TOUCH) / DRIVE ALL NIGHT / BACKSTREETS / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / JUNGLELAND / BORN TO RUN / DETROIT MEDLEY - I HEAR A TRAIN

Only performance of traditional folk song "On Top Of Old Smoky" (sung in reference to Mount St. Helens, which erupted in May 1980), and "I'm A Rocker" appears in the first set for the only time. Unusual start of show with "Prove It All Night". Roy plays "Once Upon A Time In The West" as a prelude to "The River" and, for the first time, as a bridge between that song and "Badlands". Clarence sings the opening lines of "Stagger Lee" as an introduction to "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" and Roy plays a snippet of "Hail To The Chief" during Clarence's introduction.

Audience tape - good atmosphere. Released on CDR 'The Mountain' (BTS9) and more recently from taper Pat Lee's recording as 'The Mountain Show' (Ev2), which is the full concert in high quality without any cuts, other than a brief tape flip during "Point Blank". One of the best audience recordings from this part of the tour.

HAUNTED HOUSE / BADLANDS / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT / DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN / INDEPENDENCE DAY / FACTORY / JACKSON CAGE / TWO HEARTS / OUT IN THE STREET / THE PROMISED LAND / THE PRICE YOU PAY / THE RIVER / PROVE IT ALL NIGHT / THUNDER ROAD / OUT OF LIMITS / NO MONEY DOWN - CADILLAC RANCH / HUNGRY HEART / FIRE / SHERRY DARLING / HERE SHE COMES - I WANNA MARRY YOU / WRECK ON THE HIGHWAY / THE TIES THAT BIND / STOLEN CAR / POINT BLANK / GROWIN' UP / ...

Set features a one-off version of Johnny Fuller's "Haunted House", after Bruce is carried onstage in a coffin and chased by roadies in ghost attire, and the live premiere of "The Price You Pay", an acoustic rendition with the original album lyrics. Bruce is accompanied by Danny Federici on accordion for the final verse. The alternative third verse would be premiered the following night. Springsteen opens the second set with the Marketts instrumental hit "Out Of Limits," which made #3 on Billboard's chart in early 1964. The group were apparently not allowed to cover the theme from TV's "The Outer Limits," so they edited the title and amended the tune a bit. "Jackson Cage" features an unusual guitar introduction. Roy plays "Once Upon A Time In The West" as a prelude to "The River". A fuller "No Money Down" than the previous night is used as the introduction to "Cadillac Ranch". "Growin' Up" makes its tour premiere, featuring the spaceman story.

Incomplete audience tape (Unbooted) missing the conclusion of the second set and the entire encore, including "Growin' Up"". Prior to the show, Bruce does a ten-minute TV interview with host J.J. Jackson.

34-song set features "Prove It All Night" with the long piano and guitar introduction for the first time since 1978; the only known such versions outside of the Darkness On The Edge Of Town Tour are this, the following night, and several occasions after it was resurrected in 2012. Premiere of "Fade Away" (also with a long instrumental intro) and the first "Candy's Room" of the tour. The alternative third verse of "The Price You Pay" ("some say forget the past..") is premiered, with Springsteen again accompanied by Federici on accordion as he was the previous night. "Detroit Medley" includes a snippet of "Wabash Cannonball". Clarence sings the opening lines of Lloyd Price's "Stagger Lee" as an introduction to "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)", which also includes a snippet of "Hail To The Chief" during the band introductions. Setlist corrected 11/2014 to include the previously omitted "Ramrod." Guest appearance by Jackson Browne on the tour premiere (and the last concert performance) of Chuck Berry's "Sweet Little Sixteen", see photo by clicking link above.

Two recording sources are known, an incomplete audience tape missing the first three songs, "Crush On You" and "You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)", released as 'Prove It All Night'. This tape cuts in during "Darkness On The Edge Of Town". A second recording source is complete and entered general circulation from a first generation tape via JEMS in November 2014. This excellent quality recording was captured by legendary taper Mike Millard who is best known for his series of Led Zeppelin recordings. This recording is also available on three-CD set 'Los Angeles 1980 3rd Night' (unknown label) and 'Live'r In The River' (Tarantura).

The 26-song setlist above is missing probably six to eight songs including a couple from the first set (likely to be "Out In The Street" and "The River") and several from the end of the second (judging by other setlists, probably "Crush On You", "Ramrod", "You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)", and "Drive All Night"). "The Price You Pay" and "Wreck On The Highway" are also missing from the circulating recording. The last of four nights in Los Angeles, and the set once again includes "Prove It All Night" with the piano/guitar introduction, for the final time until Barcelona in 2012. "Cadillac Ranch" again features the "No Money Down" introduction, which is now almost a full song. "Hungry Heart" features a guest appearance with Flo and Eddie, who provided backup vocals on the album cut. "Growin' Up" features the spaceman story. Clarence sings the opening lines of "Stagger Lee" as an introduction to "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)", which also includes Roy playing snippets of Bach's "Prelude No. 1 In C Major (BWV 846)" and "Hail To The Chief" during the band introductions. Bruce closes the show with "Detroit Medley" with Jackson Browne.

1980-11-05 - ASU ACTIVITY CENTER, ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY, TEMPE, AZ

BORN TO RUN / PROVE IT ALL NIGHT / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT / DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN / INDEPENDENCE DAY / FACTORY / JACKSON CAGE / TWO HEARTS / THE PROMISED LAND / OUT IN THE STREET / RACING IN THE STREET / THE RIVER / BADLANDS / THUNDER ROAD / NO MONEY DOWN - CADILLAC RANCH / HUNGRY HEART / FIRE / CANDY’S ROOM / SHERRY DARLING / HERE SHE COMES - I WANNA MARRY YOU / THE TIES THAT BIND / STOLEN CAR / WRECK ON THE HIGHWAY / POINT BLANK / CRUSH ON YOU / RAMROD / YOU CAN LOOK (BUT YOU BETTER NOT TOUCH) / DRIVE ALL NIGHT / BACKSTREETS / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / I'M A ROCKER / JUNGLELAND / DETROIT MEDLEY - I HEAR A TRAIN

One of the finest, most intense shows of the River Tour, perhaps related to the fact that Ronald Reagan had been elected president the day before – which Bruce notes with displeasure during the show. Many highlights in this show, including perhaps the definitive performance of "Drive All Night". Roy plays "Once Upon A Time In The West" as a prelude to "The River". According to Dave Marsh, during "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" Bruce fell off a speaker stack: "Bruce made one of his patented leaps to the speakers at the side of the stage. But this time he missed. The crowd just kept on cheering, but back at the sound-board where Jackson (soundman Bruce) and I were sitting, the tension was thick. Bruce might do anything, but this was weird; the band was holding the chord, and the chords of 'Rosalita' are not meant to be held for five seconds, much less fifteen. It's a good long drop from the speakers, two feet high, to the floor, a good eight or nine feet away. All there was between Bruce and the hard concrete floor was the band's monitor mixing board, but as he tumbled down, roadie Bob Werner reached out and broke the fall. (He sprained his wrist in the process.) Neither the band nor the crowd could see any of this. The next thing any of us knew, the guitar appeared, tossed atop the speakers. Then a pair of hands and at last, Springsteen's head, with his silly-faced-little-boy grin. He shook his head, pulled himself the rest of the way up, and strapped on his guitar, went back into action as if nothing had occurred.

Official concert recording available for purchase in multiple formats, including CD and high definition audio, from Springsteen's official live download site at live.brucespringsteen.net. Soundboard recording of the entire show and four-camera professionally-shot video comprised of twenty-three songs. This 160-minute film was officially released on DVD and Blu-ray as part of The Ties That Bind: The River Collection box-set, available December 4, 2015. A complete video of "Ramrod" was posted to Youtube on the 35th anniversary of the show, followed by "The River", on November 16 and "Out In The Street" on December 1. Shot on three-quarter-inch U-matic videotape for promotional use according to Thom Zimny, for posterity according to Springsteen. Ten songs are missing from the thirty-three song set: "Darkness On The Edge Of Town", "Independence Day", "Factory", "Racing In The Street", "Candy's Room", "The Ties That Bind", "Stolen Car", "Wreck On The Highway", "Point Blank" and "Backstreets". Thom Zimny has stated that these songs were not filmed. It seems possible that the four songs from Darkness On The Edge Of Town were not required for a film shot to promote The River, and some of the other songs may have been too dark and poorly lit. Audio mixed by Bob Clearmountain of these ten missing songs is available to download from live.brucespringsteen.net from December 24, 2015. The ten songs in MP3 can be downloaded for free, or purchased in standard and high-definition FLAC formats. Our information previously noted that the show was filmed by producer/director Howard Lamden (who also served as Executive Editor). Lamden had previously filmed Pink Floyd and was the Director of Jackson Browne’s early 80s Downtown documentary. However, the credits clearly note that Barry Rebo produced and directed the video footage, and was assisted by his crew. Rebo was a longtime Springsteen fan and was responsible for filming concerts and recording sessions throughout the 70s. The very brief snippets of River Tour performance footage seen in the promotional ‘10 Years Burning Down The Road’ advertisement for the Live 1975-85 box set emanate from the film of this concert. Click the link above to view this advertisement. Another tantalising snippet believed to be from this show can be seen in the 2012 documentary Wrecking Ball: A Conversation With Bruce Springsteen. Brucebase also believes that some of the concert was filmed from the audience. Soundboard tape released on CDs 'Heart and Soul' (E Street Records) and 'Live In Tempe' (Palace), and most recently remastered on CDR 'Love Soul & A Broken Heart' (Ev2). The audio recording of “Badlands” from this show (minus spoken intro) was officially released on the Live 1975-85 box set.

"Waltz Across Texas" is played in its entirety, all the verses plus sax solo. Bruce says someone gave him an Ernest Tubb album before the show.

Audience tape. Two sources circulate, both of average quality, a new source was put into circulation in June 2013 (mjk5510) containing patches from the first source to make the show almost complete missing only the opening notes of "Prove It All Night".

BADLANDS / JACKSON CAGE / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT / DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN / INDEPENDENCE DAY / FACTORY / TWO HEARTS / OUT IN THE STREET / THE PROMISED LAND / RACING IN THE STREET / THE RIVER / PROVE IT ALL NIGHT / THUNDER ROAD / NO MONEY DOWN - CADILLAC RANCH / HUNGRY HEART / FIRE / CANDY'S ROOM / BECAUSE THE NIGHT / FADE AWAY / STOLEN CAR / GROWIN' UP / WRECK ON THE HIGHWAY / POINT BLANK / THE TIES THAT BIND / RAMROD / CRUSH ON YOU / BACKSTREETS / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / BORN TO RUN / JUNGLELAND / DETROIT MEDLEY - I HEAR A TRAIN

Roy plays "Once Upon A Time In The West" as a prelude to "The River". "Growin' Up" features the spaceman story. The introduction to "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" is the opening lyrics to Jay And The Americans' "Come A Little Bit Closer"; that song also which also includes Roy playing snippets of Bach's "Prelude No. 1 In C Major (BWV 846)" and "Hail To The Chief" during the band introductions. Additional information is that "Stolen Car" is certainly on some tapes. A reader sent in the following which seems to clarify the issue, and to our minds lays it to rest "I was at both shows, November 14-15. I checked my memorabilia file and found a yellowed copy of a front-of-the-entertainment-section article from The Houston Post (since bought by the Chronicle) that is a long interview printed November 23, 1980. The interview took place after the second show, Saturday the 15th. Bruce talked about changing the set list during the show "But after we got into the set, I had to stop the guys in the band and say, 'Listen, just forget the list, don't look at it anymore, don't start anything until you hear me call it.' I was calling a lot of 'em -- Growin' Up, Crush on You, Fade Away, Stolen Car - different things from last night. That's the way it goes..." So that's a contemporary interview that appears to have been taped (lots of long quotes) where Bruce names four songs from 15 that were different from the previous night. He seems to have gotten it right. None of the four is listed on Brucebase for November 14. I think this is proof that Stolen Car was played on the 15th." Another attendee also confirms that "Stolen Car" was definitely played.

Audience tape available on CDR as 'Reaching The Summit in Houston'.

Bruce's first arena show in Chicago (although the show took place in Rosemont, a village to the northwest of Chicago) - they added this show after Bruce mentioned (on stage) they got so many letters from people who couldn't get into the Uptown. "The Price You Pay" starts acoustically and builds with gentle accompaniment from the band. Roy plays "Once Upon A Time In The West" as a prelude to "The River". "Cadillac Ranch" includes the "No Money Down" introduction. "I Wanna Marry You" does not include the usual "Here She Comes" introduction, instead Bruce reads out an amusing letter he received - click the link above to read a transcription. "Growin' Up" includes the spaceman story. Clarence sings the opening lines of "Stagger Lee" as an introduction to "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)". Bruce explained to Jimmy Fallon in 2012 that it was at this show that the crowd first sang the first verse of "Hungry Heart".

Audience tape. Released on CDs 'Wreck On The Highway' and 'The Rosemont Reception' (Ev2). The latter is from taper Rick B's recording and is the full show in high quality but has very short skips on "Born To Run" and "Fire". "I'm A Rocker" fades in.

"The Price You Pay" is again the light full-band version. Roy plays "Once Upon A Time In The West" as a prelude to "The River". Clarence sings the opening lines of "Stagger Lee" as an introduction to "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)". Bruce sings a bit of Chubby Checker's "Let's Twist Again" as an introduction to "I'm A Rocker". This show was also filmed on the in-house recording system - but no video appears to circulate, this may be as the tape was allegedly wiped over the following night as it had no sound. Apparently the audio was switched off after the 1978 concert was widely bootlegged. Click the link above to read a review of the show - it's unclear which of the Largo shows is the subject of the article, Brucebase places it here on the basis of the description of Bruce entering the crowd during "Crush On You", which he does not do the following night.

Audience tape available in two variations, on CDR 'The Price You Pay In Largo', missing "Cadillac Ranch", "Hungry Heart", "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" and "I'm A Rocker" and from a tape source with those four songs, but with "Detroit Medley" patched from the CDR source (Vittorio/hrubesh).

Roy plays "Once Upon A Time In The West" as a prelude to "The River" and as a bridge between that song and "Badlands". "Growin' Up" features the spaceman story. Bruce sings the opening of "Come A Little Bit Closer" as an introduction to "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)". Johnny Burnette and the Rock 'n Roll Trio's "Lonesome Train" is included in the "Detroit Medley" for the first time. The medley does include the "all aboard" segment, but "I Hear A Train" is dropped. The MC that introduces Springsteen is the legendary Washington-area DJ Don "Cerphe" Colwell.

Audience tape and above average pro-shot video with a few rarely played tracks. According to some sources the video tape survives as sound was recorded by hanging a microphone from the roof beams. The Springsteen camp insisted the sound was disabled on the in-house system to prevent bootlegging after the Largo show in 1978. Fortunately enterprising Capital Centre employees hooked up the microphone and ran a cable to a VCR recorder in an arena sky box. The excellent resulting footage contains many highlights - "Jackson Cage", "Badlands", "Sherry Darling" and "Detroit Medley" are stand-outs. The video circulates on several DVDs (including 'Live On The River Tour' (Watchdog), 'Lonesome Train To Maryland' (Apocalypse Sound) and a fan-made four-disc 'XP' version), although the video and audio in all circulating versions is of average quality.

Thanksgiving Day, and the band (not Bruce) are dressed in three-piece suits and ties for the occasion. "Darkness On The Edge Of Town" is dedicated to Vini Lopez and "The Price You Pay", in the full-band arrangement, to those seated behind the stage. Roy plays "Once Upon A Time In The West" as a prelude to "The River". "Growin' Up" is introduced as the song that got Bruce his record deal with CBS and Bruce dedicates the song to John Hammond; he then tells a Thanksgiving version of the spaceman story in the midsection. Clarence sings the opening lines to Lloyd Price's "Stagger Lee" as an introduction to "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)". Bruce sings a bit of Chubby Checker's "Let's Twist Again" as an introduction to "I'm A Rocker".

Audience tape. Two recording sources circulate, the first source has been released on CDR 'Look Over The River' (Z003), CD 'Thanksgiving Night' from Godfather Records and 'Downbound Train' (Libris/Odeon). The second source is from a tape transfer and is missing the first two songs as well as "I'm A Rocker" (vittorio/hrubesh). It is available with patches from 'Look Over The River'.

"Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes the "Come A Little Bit Closer" introduction. "Detroit Medley" includes a one-off "Mystery Train". "4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)" makes its tour debut.

A second source is in circulation (this is the tape that 'Mystery Train Through Madison' takes 'Detroit Medley' from). A third source is currently only in limited circulation. Some tidbit oddities in this show.

Concert features both "For You" and "4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)". Roy plays "Once Upon A Time In The West" as a prelude to "The River". For the first time, Bruce (rather than Clarence) sings the opening lines to Lloyd Price's "Stagger Lee" as an introduction to "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)". The "Detroit Medley" includes a few lines from "Pain In My Heart". A contributor writes "It was shortly after The Who concert in Cincinnati where the people were killed. To try to prevent any problems, people were allowed in VERY early. In fact the band was just finishing the soundcheck. They were doing "Prove It All Night". After running through it twice Bruce kinda looked around surprised that people were being let in. He said "Hey haven't you guys ever heard of being fashionably late? Well, what do you want to hear?" Somebody yelled out very loudly "Lost In The Flood!" Bruce said "No, we can't do that one." Somebody else yelled out "The Ties That Bind!" Bruce says "No, we'll do that one later. I got one for ya." And they played "Good Rockin' Tonight". There were maybe a couple hundred people in the place when he started, but I was told he almost caused a stampede of people thinking the show was starting and trying to get in. Anyway it was pretty cool to hear a bonus song! I know it was one of my highlights of all the Bruce shows I've seen". Another reader writes "It was a fun show. When the show was over around midnight we came out to find out that it had snowed a few inches during the show and in true upstate New York style was not going to stop for a few hours. It took my friends and me about eight hours to get back to school."

Audience tape. Best quality version is from a low-generation tape source (mjk5510).

33-song set includes the premieres of the R&B Christmas standard "Merry Christmas Baby" and Woody Guthrie's "This Land Is Your Land". "Hungry Heart" features Flo and Eddie guesting on backing vocals.

Soundboard and audience tapes. The soundboard was released on CDs 'The Other Night' (Doberman) and 'Merry Xmas Baby' (Godfather), as well as CDR 'Opening Night' and remastered on CDR 'Hussey Remaster'. An incomplete audience source of only fair quality was released on the three-LP set 'Nassau'. A second audience tape is in very limited circulation. This source includes all 33 songs and is of good quality, but the taper chose to pause the recorder between every song, removing much of the between-song chatter. Audio recordings of "Because The Night" and "Hungry Heart" from this show were officially released on the Live 1975-85 box set. The liner notes indicate that the recording of "This Land Is Your Land" is from this show, it's actually from the following night.

The song was last played in Atlanta during the Darkness On The Edge Of Town Tour, and won't be played again until September 25, 1999 in Philadelphia, PA. Fantastic show, just a notch below the show two days later. Roy Bittan plays pieces of "Once Upon A Time In The West" as a prelude to "The River" and as a bridge between that song and "Badlands".

Soundboard tape. Released on CD 'Coliseum Night' (Crystal Cat). Audio recordings of "Darkness On The Edge Of Town", "This Land Is Your Land" (not the previous night) and "You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)" from this show were officially released on the Live 1975-85 box set. In addition, the night’s outstanding performance of “Incident On 57th Street” (with clumsily reworked ending featuring a fake applause overdub) was officially released as a B-side/bonus track on 7”/12” vinyl worldwide in 1986/87, and on CD in the Japan-only Live Collection EP.

The set includes the last known version of "Rendezvous" until 1999 and the live premiere of The River outtake "Held Up Without A Gun". The New Year's Eve celebrations include "In The Midnight Hour" and the last known "Auld Lang Syne". Standout performances include "Who'll Stop The Rain", "Racing In The Street", "The River", a wonderful full-band "The Price You Pay" and an extended "Detroit Medley". Roy Bittan plays pieces of "Once Upon A Time In The West" as a prelude to "The River" and as a bridge between that song and "Badlands". "Cadillac Ranch" includes some lyrics from "No Money Down". The encores also include the second "Twist And Shout" and the penultimate "Raise Your Hand" of the River Tour.

Official concert recording available for purchase in multiple formats, including CD and high definition audio, from Springsteen's official live download site at live.brucespringsteen.net. The recording was released in March 2015 and was the fourth in a series of archive shows. The recording was mixed from the multitrack reels in March 2015 at Thrill Hill by Toby Scott, assisted by Rob Lebret and mastered by Adam Ayan at Gateway Mastering. Soundboard and audience recordings are in circulation. Prior to the release of the official download, a master recording professionally mixed from the 24-track multitracks circulated. This recording consists of 26 of the evening's 38 tracks but many songs have fade-outs. There is also a whistling / whining noise audible during quieter moments. It does include the complete "The Price You Pay" - the closing harmonica solo is edited on Crystal Cat's 'Nassau Night'. This recording was mixed by an assistant engineer at the Record Plant and here's the information directly from him: "I was working as an assistant engineer at the Record Plant, and we recorded a number of shows on the tour for a live album. When they came back to Los Angeles, Toby Scott was starting to mix. I asked him if he would allow me to do a mix and evaluate my skills. He let me use the 24 track masters to do one song. He liked what I did and said if I want to play some more I could. I had forgotten about the tapes until a few days ago while going through some old boxes." This pro-mixed recording is available on CDR 'Nassau Coliseum - From Master Tapes' (Ev2). The soundboard recording is available on CDs 'Nassau Night' (Crystal Cat), 'Midnight Lightning' (Seagull), 'St. Sylvester's Day Concert 1980' (Growin' Records), and CDR 'In The Midnight Hour' (Great Dane) as well as the five-LP sets 'The Night They Drove Old '80 Down' and 'Happy New Year'. Meanwhile, the audience tape is noteworthy for including the complete "Raise Your Hand", which is cut short on the soundboard. An audio recording of "4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)" from this show was officially released on the Live 1975-85 box set. In addition, the night’s performance of "Merry Christmas Baby" was officially released on 7”/12” vinyl in 1986 (as well as on the Very Special Christmas Various Artists benefit sampler LP/CD); "Rendezvous" was officially released on Tracks in 1998, and "Held Up Without A Gun" was officially released on the Essential Bruce Springsteen bonus CD in 2003. About fourteen minutes worth of amateur film footage shot from the audience - including "In The Midnight Hour", the New Year’s countdown, and the first seconds of 1981, with Bruce spraying champagne all over the front row - is circulating among collectors.

* 1981

Continuation of "The River" tour

1981-01-20 - MAPLE LEAF GARDENS, TORONTO, ON

PROVE IT ALL NIGHT / TWO HEARTS / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT / DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN / INDEPENDENCE DAY / FACTORY / WHO'LL STOP THE RAIN / THE PROMISED LAND / OUT IN THE STREET / RACING IN THE STREET / THE RIVER / BADLANDS / THUNDER ROAD / CADILLAC RANCH / SHERRY DARLING / HUNGRY HEART / FIRE / CANDY'S ROOM / BECAUSE THE NIGHT / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) / FOR YOU / STOLEN CAR / WRECK ON THE HIGHWAY / POINT BLANK / THE TIES THAT BIND / RAMROD / BACKSTREETS / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / I'M A ROCKER / JUNGLELAND / BORN TO RUN / DETROIT MEDLEY - I HEAR A TRAIN

Roy plays "Once Upon A Time In The West" as a prelude to "The River" and as a bridge between that song and "Badlands". Bruce sings the opening lines of "Stagger Lee" as an introduction to "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)". First ever performances in Canada of "Two Hearts", "Factory", "Who'll Stop The Rain", "Out In The Street", "The River", "Cadillac Ranch", "Sherry Darling", "Hungry Heart", "Stolen Car", "Wreck On The Highway", "Ramrod", and "I'm A Rocker".

Audience tape (with fairly clear sound) and partial soundboard of the last twelve songs. Two recording sources circulate, a new very good quality complete source was put into circulation in March 2014 via JEMS (mackeck). The high quality soundboard tape fades in during "4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)". Soundboard released on CD 'I'm A Rocker', which fades out during "Detroit Medley". A first generation source of the soundboard also circulates on CDR with the last track uncut. The originally circulated soundboard portion from this show was dubbed off a cassette tape a Springsteen crew member had left in his car when bringing it into a garage for repair works. Brucebase reader Greg Wible takes up the story: "Early 80s I was Sales Manager for a certain European Auto Dealer in Hermosa Beach, California. We sold a new car to Marc Brickman, Bruce's Lighting Manager. Marc lived in West LA and brought his car in for standard servicing. Back in those days we would manually update the owners manual maintenance chart when the servicing was done. Owners manual was in the glove compartment, as was a single cassette tape. I played it in the car for a few seconds, then made a mad dash to our bachelor beach house on the Strand in Hermosa Beach about two miles away. I tossed the tape to my buddy Les to perform the dub on the quite analog dual tape deck rig. I jammed back to work and Les returned the tape back about an hour later in time before Marc picked up his serviced car. Marc had that tape because during the Toronto show introduction to "Stolen Car", Bruce mentions going to a friends wedding at a temple...that was Marc's wedding." Greg also notes that the tape warp in "Stolen Car" was where the original dubbed audio tape had broken and Les had to take the tape apart and use scotch tape to piece it back together.

Audience tape. Three recording sources circulate, the first is available complete as part of the River Flood project and on 'From Asbury Park In Love' (Earlmv) (missing "Night"). A second incomplete recording source circulates from mjk5510; this recording is only fourteen tracks, and three of those are significantly cut. A third complete recording source was put into circulation in January 2014 from the master tapes via JEMS (mackeck), this source is a nice upgrade over the previous sources.

1981-01-29 - HILTON COLISEUM, IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY, AMES, IA

PROVE IT ALL NIGHT / TWO HEARTS / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT / DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN / INDEPENDENCE DAY / JACKSON CAGE / WHO'LL STOP THE RAIN / THE PROMISED LAND / OUT IN THE STREET / RACING IN THE STREET / THE RIVER / BADLANDS / THUNDER ROAD / CADILLAC RANCH / SHERRY DARLING / HUNGRY HEART / FIRE / YOU CAN LOOK (BUT YOU BETTER NOT TOUCH) / 4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) / FOR YOU / WRECK ON THE HIGHWAY / POINT BLANK / CANDY'S ROOM / RAMROD / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / I'M A ROCKER / JUNGLELAND / BORN TO RUN / DETROIT MEDLEY - I GOT YOU (I FEEL GOOD) - I HEAR A TRAIN

The show features the return of "Jackson Cage". Although missing from the audience tape, reviews imply that Roy played the "Once Upon A Time In The West" introduction to "Badlands" (and so presumably to "The River"). "I Got You (I Feel Good)" is included in "Detroit Medley". A newspaper article mentions that 29 songs were played, so the setlist above may still be missing a track. It remains a possibility that the reporter was mistaken. A fan present writes "In the encores the crowd started running around the upper level (completely around the coliseum) and Bruce started singing "I see a train" over and over." This event is corroborated in the newspaper review.

Audience tape circulates from the master cassettes (Gizmo) and is missing six songs ("Independence Day", "Racing In The Street", "The River", "Point Blank", "Candy's Room", and "Jungleland") as taper stated he only brought in two tapes. Show has also been released on CDR 'Judged And Handed Life Down In Ames'.

Audience tape released on CD 'Convicted & Sentenced: Life Without Parole' (Mystic) and upgraded in October 2013 from first generation cassettes, 'Kansas City Baby' (JEMS). Unfortunately, while trying to save tape while transferring his recording the taper used fades between some songs to remove audience noise, occasionally clipping the first notes of some tracks. This is evident on all circulating recordings.

1981-02-07 - ASSEMBLY HALL, UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS, CHAMPAIGN, IL

PROVE IT ALL NIGHT / TWO HEARTS / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT / DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN / INDEPENDENCE DAY / WHO'LL STOP THE RAIN / THE PROMISED LAND / OUT IN THE STREET / THIS LAND IS YOUR LAND / THE RIVER / BADLANDS / THUNDER ROAD / CADILLAC RANCH / SHERRY DARLING / HUNGRY HEART / FIRE / YOU CAN LOOK (BUT YOU BETTER NOT TOUCH) / HERE SHE COMES - I WANNA MARRY YOU / FOR YOU / WRECK ON THE HIGHWAY / STOLEN CAR / POINT BLANK / CANDY'S ROOM / RAMROD / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / I'M A ROCKER / JUNGLELAND / BORN TO RUN / DETROIT MEDLEY / TWIST AND SHOUT

Roy plays "Once Upon A Time In The West" as a prelude to "The River" and as a bridge between that song and "Badlands".

Audience tape. Two sources circulate, the first is released on the fast running 'Stuck Inside Of Mobile' and more recently on the good 'A Night Of Singing, Dancing And Howling' (Ev2) which runs at the right speed. The only (and sometimes very irritating) fault with this source is the woman next to the taper screaming her head off frequently - the good sound/show almost makes up for the racket. A new tape transfer of a second source was put into circulation in July 2013 (mjk5510), this source is very good quality with little to no audience noise.

Audience tape (Mjk5510) of good quality. Best version is a 2013 tape transfer by mjk5510.

The circulating audience tape is incomplete, with four songs ("Fade Away", "You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)", "Because The Night" and "Stolen Car") patched in from a poor quality uncirculated recording of the February 16, 1981 show in Lakeland, FL. The second recorder source can be confirmed by comments made by Bruce audible on an alternative tape source, when he dedicates "4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)" to "everybody from Jacksonville University".

A review in the Red & Black, student newspaper of the University Of Georgia, says the show finished with "Mystery Train", but that can't be confirmed by the audience tape. It's possible the reviewer mistook "I Hear A Train" or another part of "Detroit Medley" with the song best known as a Elvis Presley classic from 1955. It's perhaps more likely that "Mystery Train" was included in "Detroit Medley", just as Springsteen did earlier in the tour in New York. As usual, Roy plays "Once Upon A Time In The West" as a prelude to "The River" and as a bridge between that song and "Badlands". Click the link above to read the article from the Red & Black.

Audience tape. Most of "Detroit Medley" is cut.

No known audio, and we are uncertain as to the source of the setlist above. A purported audience tape from this date entered circulation in 2012 but it has been confirmed as a fake. The majority of tracks on this tape are actually from the excellent January 28, 1981 St Louis recording, with a few others from an unidentified second recording.

Roy plays "Once Upon A Time In The West" as a prelude to "The River" and as a bridge between that song and "Badlands". A fan present recalls: "I remember he played "Candy's Room", and I also remember that a small group of about 4,000 of us kept chanting and clapping loooong after the "Detroit Medley" was over, and Bruce and the Band came back out again, (it was obvious they had showered, and changed clothes!) and did "Twist and Shout", and absolutely knocked us DEAD!!"

First ever Springsteen performance of Creedence Clearwater Revival's "Run Through The Jungle", which opens the show to stunning effect. Perhaps more of an adaptation than a cover, with an ethereal arrangement, lyrical variations throughout and even extra verses, presumably penned by Springsteen:
Well now the land's on fire
It's written in blood in the sky
Better load shotguns out of the trunk
The city's burning tonight
Better wake up, look out your window
I see the tide is turning
'Cause out across the cornfield tonight
I see crosses burning
(courtesy springsteenlyrics.com)
Click the link above for audio of "Run Through The Jungle". Roy plays "Once Upon A Time In The West" as a prelude to "The River". During "Racing In The Street", Bruce unusually reprises the chorus at the end of the outro.

"Rockin' All Over The World" includes a unique extended, apparently improvised introduction.

1981-05-07 - JOHANNESHOVS ISSTADION, STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN

FOLLOW THAT DREAM / PROVE IT ALL NIGHT / OUT IN THE STREET / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT / DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN / INDEPENDENCE DAY / WHO'LL STOP THE RAIN / TWO HEARTS / THE PROMISED LAND / THIS LAND IS YOUR LAND / THE RIVER / BADLANDS / THUNDER ROAD / CADILLAC RANCH / SHERRY DARLING / HUNGRY HEART / FIRE / YOU CAN LOOK (BUT YOU BETTER NOT TOUCH) / STOLEN CAR / RACING IN THE STREET / BACKSTREETS / CANDY'S ROOM / RAMROD / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / BORN TO RUN / DETROIT MEDLEY - HIGH SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL - I HEAR A TRAIN / ROCKIN' ALL OVER THE WORLD

Roy plays "Once Upon A Time In The West" as a prelude to "The River" and as a bridge between that song and "Badlands". "Detroit Medley" includes "High School Confidential". First ever performances in Sweden of "Follow That Dream", "Fire", and "Stolen Car".

Audience tapes. Two recordings are known to exist. The first was originally bootlegged on vinyl as 'Follow That Dream' (unknown label) and subsequently on CDs with the same title (Boss Records, Golden Stars), remastered version 'Follow That Dream Revisited' (Piggham) and in improved quality on CDR 'Warm Welcome In Stockholm' (Ev2) and 'Follow That Dream' (Godfather). Fairly regular crackles indicate that all these CDs use the vinyl as source, and feature several edits, most notably in "The River" and "The Promised Land". An alternative tape (from MJK5510) emerged in January 2013 without edits in these two songs, but with edits in "Who'll Stop The Rain" (missing 10 seconds), "Thunder Road" (38 seconds), "Backstreets" (missing 19 seconds from the introduction) and "Detroit Medley" (54 seconds). Patched versions of these songs are available. Both recordings are good, but the vinyl sourced 'Warm Welcome In Stockholm' is among the best of the tour and a fine representation of a wonderful show.

Bruce introduces his niece JoAnn Springsteen during "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" and "Detroit Medley" includes both "High School Confidential" and "Land Of 1000 Dances". This show is considered by many to be the best of all the European shows.

Audience tapes. Released on CD 'Teardrops On The City' and also 'Teardrops On The City Revisited' which is remastered from the LP version and out on Piggham Records. A second source emerged in 2013 (via MJK5510) which includes the complete "Run Through The Jungle" (the start is cut on 'Teardrops On The City'). Several other tracks do have edits, however.

THIS LAND IS YOUR LAND / THE PROMISED LAND (with Jackson Browne) / JOLE BLON (with Gary U.S. Bonds) / HUNGRY HEART (with Gary U.S. Bonds and Jackson Browne) / BROTHER JOHN IS GONE (with Jackson Browne, Gary U.S. Bonds, Graham Nash, Stephen Stills, et al.)

Fourth annual Survival Sunday anti-nuclear benefit with Jackson Browne and Gary U.S. Bonds as well as Springsteen. After an introduction by Ron Kovic, Bruce begins with a solo "This Land Is Your Land", before being joined by Jackson Browne on an acoustic duet of "The Promised Land" and by Gary U.S. Bonds on a full-band duet on "Jole Blon", Bruce's first ever performance of the song in the U.S. The five-hour-plus extravaganza closes with the traditional gospel number "Brother John Is Gone", with all artists on stage (Bruce's first ever performance of the song). Ronald Reagan's younger daughter Patti Davis speaks at the event, as does Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Bonnie Raitt, Graham Nash, Stephen Stills, Nicolette Larson, Kenny Rankin, Timothy B. Schmit, Peter Yarrow, The Chambers Brothers & The Chambers Family Choir, Father Guido Sarducci, and The Hollywood Rock 'N Roll Revue (the evening's house band) also perform.

Soundboard tape of first four songs. There is video footage of several of the songs available, most recently on DVD 'Years Of Innocence'. According to press reports, Springsteen led the all-purpose backup band through "Cadillac Ranch" in the soundcheck.

1981-06-22 - MAX WEINBERG WEDDING RECEPTION, EAST ORANGE, NJ

YOU CAN LOOK (BUT YOU BETTER NOT TOUCH) / HUNGRY HEART / HERE SHE COMES / JERSEY GIRL

Other set details unknown. The wedding reception for Max Weinberg and his bride Rebecca (“Becky”). Bruce and the entire E Street Band attended and played a lengthy set. A source recalls that one of the songs Springsteen performed was “Jersey Girl” (very plausible, as Bruce premiered a cover version at his next public concert). From the clips that are available, "You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)", "Hungry Heart", and "Here She Comes" are also known to have been played. It seems likely that "I Wanna Marry You" followed the latter (a short clip of which can be seen on Thom Zimny's documentary The Ties That Bind), but we have no evidence to confirm it.

The entire event was video and audio recorded but only a very brief snippet has surfaced.

Start of the final leg of "The River" tour

1981-07-02 - BRENDAN BYRNE ARENA, EAST RUTHERFORD, NJ

Tour debuts of "Jersey Girl" and "I Don't Want To Go Home", the first ever performances in the U.S. of "Johnny Bye-Bye" and "Follow That Dream", and the last time that "Born To Run" opens the set. Roy plays "Once Upon A Time In The West" as a prelude to "Badlands". This show was the first of any event at Meadowlands; Bruce opened the arena this night. This show made the local TV news mainly due to the crass case of ticket scalping surrounding Bruce's entire Meadowlands stand.

Audience tape and soundboard recording of one song. Released on CDR 'Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, Meadowlands, NJ July 2, 1981' - this CD misses the last track.

Concert is a benefit for the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation and features passionate versions of many songs, including "The River", "Who'll Stop The Rain", "Prove It All Night", and "Darkness On The Edge Of Town". Also includes a stunning "Ballad Of Easy Rider", the only known performance. Springsteen stops singing during "The River", either due to overwhelming emotion or to shake hands with the veterans seated around the stage - opinion is divided. An outstanding “Detroit Medley” includes snippets of “I Hear A Train”, "Land Of 1000 Dances", “Sweet Soul Music” and “Shake”. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" also includes a brief "Sweet Soul Music" during the band introductions. Widely considered one of Springsteen's finest shows.

Audience tape and partial (45 minutes of the first set) soundboard. Released on CD 'A Night For The Vietnam Veteran' (Winged Wheel), and 'Written On The Wall' from a remastered tape. Now available as a direct master recording remaster by Ev2 which has the complete "This Land Is Your Land" and "Twist And Shout" from the very good sounding audience tape. None of the previous recordings/sources had these two songs as complete from the better sounding audience tape. This is the same source as "Written On The Wall" but from a direct master recording which results in a slightly better sound quality - 'As Dreams Don't Mean Nothin' - A Night For The Vietnam Veterans' (Ev2).

1981-09-24 - CLARENCE CLEMONS WEDDING RECEPTION, HONOLULU, HI

No set details known. Wedding reception for the Big Man and his bride, Christina Sandgren. The entire E Street Band, key management and respective wives/girlfriends attended, as well as Bruce and his then-girlfriend Joyce Hyser. Springsteen acted as “Best Man”. As had been the case at Max Weinberg’s wedding three months earlier, Bruce & the E Street Band performed a lengthy, rollicking set at the reception, all of which was audio and video recorded – but none of which has surfaced to collectors. This event (albeit a private and unofficial one) remains the only known Springsteen performance in the state of Hawaii.

Springsteen visits studio sessions being conducted by Steve Van Zandt for his work-in-progress debut solo album and provides harmony vocals on the three above-mentioned tracks. Van Zandt's core backing band for the project consisted of Garry Tallent, Max Weinberg, and Danny Federici. Springsteen's contributions are not credited in the album liner notes but have been subsequently confirmed in interview by Van Zandt.

The three recordings featuring Bruce's guest spots were included on Little Steven's Men Without Women album when it was released in October 1982.

OUT OF WORK / CLUB SOUL CITY / LOVE’S ON THE LINE / HOLD ON (TO WHAT YOU GOT) / ANGELYNE / ALL I NEED / RENDEZVOUS / SOUL DEEP

Sessions for Gary U.S. Bonds and probably the most extensive Springsteen involvement in any outside album project to date. Although Springsteen and Steve Van Zandt are listed as co-producers of all 11 tracks on the album, Bruce was actually involved with only eight of them – “Soul Deep” (the old Box Tops hit), plus the seven Springsteen songs, six of which were previously unreleased (“Rendezvous” had been covered by Greg Kihn in 1979). Bruce is not credited as playing or singing on the album but he did directly participate (along with the E Street Band) on most of them. Two or three additional Springsteen compositions were also recorded and considered during the Bonds sessions.

All of the above-mentioned recordings were released on Bonds’ On The Line in June.

1982-03-00 - WESTLAKE STUDIOS, LOS ANGELES, CA

PROTECTION

Springsteen and Roy Bittan fly to Los Angeles in early March to participate in a Quincy Jones-produced recording session for Donna Summer’s work-in-progress album. The session took place either on or about March 8. After initially considering “Cover Me” for donation, Bruce opted to give Donna the stylistically similar “Protection”. The owner of Summer’s record label (David Geffen) was friends with Jon Landau and had asked if Bruce might have a spare song available for her. Springsteen contributed vocals and lead guitar at the session, with Bittan on piano.

Several uncirculated alternate different takes of “Protection” were recorded in Los Angeles, included a Summer-Springsteen duet. Collectors note: a fake “duet’ version (made in the late 1990s by some fan by layering the official Summer version with a Springsteen studio outtake version) is in circulation. “Protection” was first released in August on Summer’s self-titled album.

1982-05-02 - THE STONE PONY, ASBURY PARK, NJ

LONG TALL SALLY / TWIST AND SHOUT

With Cats On A Smooth Surface. This was the start of a series of shows which grew in popularity and became well attended. Most of the songs that were performed with Bruce on any given night were either songs the band knew or quickly rehearsed with Bruce backstage at the Pony. He would then join them onstage after the last set at 2:30 AM where he, even at that hour, would put on an amazing show. Truly inspirational and energetic even though at that hour there would usually be thirty or forty people left in the audience (at the earlier jams) before Bruce took the stage. After the third or fourth time that he sat in with Cats, word that he was making regular appearances Sundays at the Pony quickly got out and the regular crowd of about two-hundred people grew to a capacity crowd of over eight-hundred -- and that was every week whether he showed up or not. All local and national media had ongoing blurbs of his jams with Cats but neither the band nor the Stone Pony did any special advertising to exploit the fact that he played with them so regularly. The band felt privileged to have him there with them and would never sour that relationship.

Interestingly, it was a fledgling Bon Jovi band that was the resident artist at the Fast Lane, and he would jokingly complain about the lack of audiences at the Fast Lane on those Sunday nights blaming it on Bruce playing with Cats at the Pony and taking all the crowds from him.

Bruce joins Jersey Shore legends Sonny Kenn & The Wild Ideas on stage at the Monmouth County Fair. Performing with The Starfires in 1965, Sonny Kenn even opened for Jerry Lee Lewis. At the time, however, Kenn was working in a musical instrument store in Red Bank by day, before playing with The Wild Ideas in various Shore bars and clubs at night. Before jumping on stage, Bruce watched events at the County Fair, wearing blue jeans, a flannel shirt, and a CAT baseball cap. Songs performed include "Sweet Little Sixteen" and "Land of 1000 Dances". Not long after this performance, Springsteen wrote and recorded "County Fair", perhaps, in part, inspired by this evening.

With Beaver Brown. Also on the bill tonight is George Theiss, Springsteen's bandmate from The Castiles. Springsteen did not perform with Theiss. Brucebase reader Cliff, who attended the show, notes that Bruce arrived towards the end of Theiss's set and George spotted him sitting at the bar just as he finished his set. George then announced he was going to do one more for an old friend, or something to that effect, looking Bruce in the eye as he said it. Unfortunately, Cliff can't remember what song George played.

PINK CADILLAC

Springsteen drops in to visit Chuck Plotkin and Toby Scott, who are the respective Producer and Recording Engineer for Bette Midler’s work-in-progress album No Frills. Springsteen donates his (at the time) unreleased and never-performed song “Pink Cadillac” to the Midler project. It is unclear if a pre-recorded demo was submitted or if Bruce spent some time teaching on-hand session musicians the song. The actual Midler recording of the song took place a couple of weeks later, but Springsteen wasn’t involved in that formal session. Midler gave the public world debut of “Pink Cadillac” on December 8 in Portland, Oregon. The song was performed as the show opener during Midler’s entire December 1982 – September 1983 Tour. However, the Midler live version (which apparently mirrors her studio version) is a major adaptation, with Bruce’s middle lyric verse removed and additional lyrics of a song by John David Martin called “Cadillac Walk” sequenced into the end of Bruce’s song.

Although Midler was allowed to perform the song in that arrangement throughout the tour, Springsteen, after hearing the Midler studio version, would not allow her to release it on her July 1983 No Frills album. “Pink Cadillac-Cadillac Walk” was pulled from the album and replaced by a Midler cover of the Rolling Stones’ “Beast Of Burden”.

With The Diamonds. The Diamonds were a local (Jersey shore) all original rock and soul band that included Cats On A Smooth Surface's then ex-members Harry Filkin and Pete Schulle who left Cats in mid-October 1982. The Diamonds also included an original Cats member by the name of Joel Krauss who left Cats in 1980. They performed their material in select Jersey and Manhattan clubs which catered to bands that showcased their original songs. The guitarist that replaced Cats' Harry Filkin was local boy Glen Burtnik of "Beatlemania" fame who played with Cats for a while before leaving to pursue original music of his own. He's now better known as a member for the last 15 years or so of the re-formed 70's band Styx.

SAVIN’ UP / SUMMER ON SIGNAL HILL

Sessions for Clarence Clemons & The Red Bank Rockers debut album Rescue. Springsteen provides the rhythm guitar on “Savin’ Up and arranges and co-produces the instrumental “Summer On Signal Hill” (both of which he wrote). Contrary to myth it is not Bruce and the E Street Band performing in disguise on non-album b-side “Summer On Signal Hill” – the outstanding lead guitar on this track is courtesy of David Landau (Jon Landau’s brother).

Both the album and the non-album b-side were released in mid-October 1983. The Martin Kahan-directed video for “A Woman’s Got The Power” (the A-side of the “Summer On Signal Hill” single) features a brief, non-speaking cameo appearance by Springsteen (as a car wash attendant). The video was filmed in early autumn 1983 and first released in February 1984.

No set details known. Private jam session featuring just Bruce and Nils Lofgren, who had just recently been dropped by his record label (MCA/Backstreets). Lofgren has recounted the details in interview:….I went up to spend a weekend with him in New Jersey and he had just finished the (Born In The U.S.A.) record…. spent the weekend with him going to bars and jamming, talking a lot..…I was kind of down in the dumps then, and he was offering support. We played his record in the car and at his home, and I was just fascinated with it and thought it was the best record he’d ever made. When I first heard "Dancing In The Dark" I said to him, "Oh my God, that’s a hit record”…..it was strange because we were watching MTV together when they announced that Little Steven had left the group to do his own thing and that his replacement was going to be someone from New Jersey. Bruce told me at the time it (the replacement person being from NJ story) was bull…..I took that opportunity to say to Bruce, “gee, if you ever need a guitarist, I’d love an audition”. Bruce looked at me kind of funny and said, "Really?"….it was a good chance and a nice accident that I just happened to be there….sure enough, four or five months later when he needed someone, I got the call and it worked out.

FIRE / ROCKIN' ALL OVER THE WORLD

Bruce jumps on stage for two songs with Clarence Clemons & The Red Bank Rockers. Eric Davis has the story: "So there we were: me, Bruce, his buddy (I believe his name was Phil, and he was Bruce’s trainer), and the club owner. Period. We enjoyed the last few songs of the set, and then Clarence and the band approached where we were standing as they left the stage. Clarence saw Bruce, gave him a big hug, then returned to the stage for the encores. During this tour, Clarence’s band was doing Bruce’s song “Fire” as their encore – but instrumentally. Halfway through the song, there’s a big sustained note, which Clarence held for what seemed like forever. Phil tapped Bruce on the shoulder, and said: “I think that’s your cue.” Bruce grinned again, and passed me on his way to the stage. As he appeared, the crowd went nuts, and pressed forward toward the stage." For the rest of the story, check out Eric's blog.

1984-05-26 - XANADU, ASBURY PARK, NJ

DANCING IN THE DARK

World premiere of "Dancing In The Dark", with Bruce guesting with the group Bystander. Thomas Kiely was a DJ for various clubs on the Jersey Shore in the 70s and 80s including Xanadu, and he was kind enough to send his recollections in to Brucebase: On Saturday May 26 1984 Bystander is playing at the club Xanadu in Asbury Park. The club is packed and Bruce is in the house. The band had recently learned Dancing in the Dark by getting a promotional single of the song prior to its general release. Before playing the song the band announced that Bruce was in the club and that they were about to play his new single. The band asked aloud if Bruce would like to join them on the stage to sing it. Immediately there was a rush to the stage. The band stalled for as long as they could but Bruce didn’t come forward and eventually they began to play the song. Hoping to entice Bruce to join them, instead of going into the song after the intro, the band vamped the intro over again for a second time. Perhaps Bruce, not wishing to embarrass himself, was waiting to see how well the band could play the song, who knows, but after doing the intro for a second time, Bruce jumped up on the stage, grabbed the mic and started to sing at the very last second right on cue. Needless to say the house went wild.

Opening night of the tour includes live debuts of four songs from Born In The U.S.A. ("No Surrender", "I'm On Fire", "Working On The Highway" and "Bobby Jean") and five from Nebraska. The other four songs from Born In The U.S.A. in the set all received their debuts at club appearances prior to the tour. “No Surrender” is one of two full band arrangement versions played on the tour and features a rewritten last verse. This verse is played on all versions of this song during the tour: Now on the streets tonight the lights are growing dim / The walls in my room are closing in / But it's good to see your smiling face / And to hear your voice again / Now we could sleep in the twilight / By the river bed / With a wide open country in our hearts / And these romantic dreams in our heads. "Dancing In The Dark" is played twice for the video shoot, directed by Brian De Palma. Pulled out of the audience during the shoot to dance with Bruce is actress Courteney Cox, later to become a household name as Monica in Friends. Cox is reported to have been paid $350 for her efforts. Debut performance of The Rolling Stones' "Street Fighting Man".

Audience tape. Two recording sources circulate the first was released on CD 'Street Fighting Man' (RTC). A second source of good quality is also available as CDR 'Opening Night Of The Born In The U.S.A. Tour' (Uber Series, Ev2) and is also used for CDs 'Opening Night In Saint Paul' (Hot Stuff) and 'Ready For The World' (Godfather).

Set features the world premiere and one of only three outings for "Man At The Top". Bruce sings a (very) short version of "Sad Eyes" during the middle of "Backstreets" (what a teaser). A rare "No Surrender" that does not include the harmonica solo after the second chorus, but has Bruce singing the Sha-la-la verse (acoustic version #1). "Pink Cadillac" is performed in a rearranged version of the single with a lengthy intro about The Garden of Eden. Clarence is introduced as “The eighth wonder” during "Sherry Darling". Also the start of "Cadillac Ranch" is extended as Bruce's guitar fails to work. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes the "Come A Little Bit Closer" introduction. "Detroit Medley" contains an excellent "I Hear A Train". No "Travelin' Band" included in the medley yet.

Audience tapes - two recording sources available. The first can be found on the four-LP set 'At Alpine Valley Vol. 1 and 2'. A second source of excellent quality was released on CD 'Alpine Valley Night' (Crystal Cat).

Audience tape and partial professionally shot video. Set includes the live premiere of "My Father's House" and a rare "Ramrod" - one of only five performances in 1984. "Who'll Stop The Rain" also features. Soundboard from video of fifteen songs (second set and encores) also available on CDR 'Part Of The Show' and 'Ten Years Burning Down The Road' (Rattlesnake), which is a "lossy" recording. Full show released on CDR 'Toronto Last Light 84' - not sure if the soundboard tracks are included in this one. A very high quality professionally shot film of the second set and encores circulates on DVD, released by several different labels. 'Hot Fun In The Summertime' from Watchdog has a permanent logo burnt into the top left of the screen. 'Do You Love Me' from Hot Stuff eliminates the logo, but instead has a logo that is only visible for a few seconds between songs. Ruthless Copying Records subsequently released two versions, the second of which (titled 'Whole Lotta Rosie Revisited') has the logo digitally removed and is the one to acquire. This footage is particularly notable for fine renditions of "Backstreets" and "Jungleland", as well as the final encores.

"Backstreets" again has a lengthy intro and a short 'Sad Eyes' in the middle.

Audience tape. Two recording sources circulate, the better of the two sources is available from the master tapes (hobbes444), the start of "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" is cut on this source but a patched version circulates. Released on CDR 'Follow That Dream In NJ'.

The third, and best quality source entered into circulation in November 2013 and is missing three songs ("Downbound Train", "I'm On Fire" and "Cover Me"), however, the missing tracks have been patched in from another source to form the complete show.

Speaking before "Johnny 99", Bruce responded to Reagan. "Well, the President was mentioning my name in his speech the other day," he said, "and I kind of got to wondering what his favorite album of mine must've been...I don´t think it was the Nebraska album, I don't think he's been listening to this one." "Glory Days" includes a couple bars of "Out Of Limits" in the introduction and "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes a bar of "Hail To The Chief" in the midsection.

Audience tape. Available on CD. "Born To Run" and "Detroit Medley" were filmed from the audience, possibly by local news. This would most likely have been done in an "unofficial" capacity.

Audience tape. Two recording sources circulate. Please note that this is the correct setlist, confirmed via the JEMS archives master tapes which now circulates. The CDR 'Down With The Flu In Tacoma' seems to be a mixture of other audience tapes, including the final night at the Brendan Byrne Arena in East Rutherford. Some audience shot video exists.

1984-10-18 - TACOMA DOME, TACOMA, WA

Struck down with flu, Springsteen is forced to reschedule to the following day. When the children of the first and second grade of Roy Elementary School found out about Bruce's flu, they put together a care package of their performance of "Hungry Heart" and sent it to him. He replied with a performance of his own, a partial acoustic recording of "Hungry Heart" with the vocal accompaniment of Roy Bittan. He also thanked them for the letters and pictures they'd sent, and said he'd hope to visit Roy Elementary next time he was in town. The tape was broadcast on at least one local radio station.

"Growin' Up" features the bear story. "Twist And Shout" includes a couple lines from "It Takes Two", as well the "Do You Love Me" segment. This show took place on October 19 - the concert had originally been scheduled for the night before (see ticket stub linked above) but at the last minute had to be postponed for 24 hours due to Bruce being ill.

Audience tape. Two recording sources circulate. The first is released on CD ‘Street Fighting Boss’ (BM) and the four-LP set 'Simply The Best Gig Vol 1 and 2'. In 2012 an upgrade straight from the master cassettes was released on 'I Feel So Much Better, ' (JEMS).

Bruce’s parents Douglas and Adele, who lived nearby, were in attendance at this Oakland show (Bruce dedicated "Mansion On The Hill" to his dad). Three weeks prior to this show Bruce parents had given a little-known-about, but highly fascinating, interview at their home to a local journalist from their small hometown newspaper in San Mateo – incredibly this would turn out to be the only interview that Bruce’s father ever granted. Please click on the link above to read the interview.

Audience tape with "Born In The U.S.A.", "Darlington County" and "Badlands" fading in. Roy plays a snippet of "Out Of Limits" during the introduction to "Glory Days". "Growin' Up" features the bear story. Released on CD ‘Oakland Night’ (Crystal Cat) and 'Reason To Believe In Oakland' (Cellar Dweller) . On this same day MTV have a one hour Sunday Special which includes footage from Meadowlands.

Set features the last "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" of 1984, which features a snippet of "Hail To The Chief" during the band introductions.

Audience tape. There are at least two different tape transfers of this show which are actually a mix of Los Angeles 1984 dates and the St. Louis 1984 show. These wrongly dated tapes are widely circulating among those who collect unbooted shows. Recently however a full show original source tape has surfaced which has the above complete setlist. Collectors can note that "Pink Cadillac" is split across two tracks which will help identify this source.

Set includes the last Born In The U.S.A. Tour performance of "State Trooper". Curiously (and perhaps mistakenly) Bruce switches the order of the third verse around. Unlike the album take (and other live performances) the "In the wee wee hours your mind gets hazy, radio relay towers gonna lead me to my baby" lyric appears after "The radio's jammed up with talk show stations, it's just talk, talk, talk, talk, till you lose your patience." "Johnny Bye-Bye" includes the "Mystery Train" outro. "Growin' Up" features the bear story.

Considered to be one of the biggest concerts ever held in Nebraska up to this time. "Reason To Believe" has a introduction with Bruce on the harmonica and Roy on the keyboards, similar to many performances on this tour. "Johnny Bye-Bye" has a few lines of "Mystery Train" attached at the end. Second and last known "Sugarland". "Racing In The Street" has the keyboard intro.

"Reason To Believe" has a introduction with Bruce on the harmonica and Roy on the keyboards. "Johnny Bye-Bye" is introduced by Bruce as "Bye-Bye Johnny", and includes a few lines of "Mystery Train" towards the end. "Racing In The Street" includes the now usual introduction and also a spoken part at the end. "Kansas City" is included in the "Detroit Medley".

Audience tape, probably the best of the tour. Reports on this show indicate that the original tape (or a first generation copy of it) was used for a radio broadcast in it's entirety and that this broadcast was the source for the generally circulating tapes including the release 'Kansas City Night' (Crystal Cat). Now the show is available directly from Rick B's master recording. Edited directly from the master, the result ('Roses In The Kansas Rain' from Ev2) is far less cut and processed than the Crystal Cat release. 'Thunder Road' fades out on the Crystal Cat release, but it is complete on this one. Also available on 'Mystery Train In Kansas City' (Anubis) and multiple LP releases including 'Reasons To Believe' (Holsten Team), 'Kansas City Here I Come' (Asbury Park) and 'Kansas City Part 1 & 2'.

It is stated in the book Blinded by the Light that the set included a version of "Memphis Tennessee" but it is not in evidence on the known tapes. It's likely that the Chuck Berry song was included in "Detroit Medley", as it was the following night in the same venue. "Twist And Shout" followed by "Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town" most likely closed the set.

Audience tape (incomplete). "Out In The Street" is missing from the tape, but the opening bars can clearly be heard following "Johnny Bye-Bye" (which includes the "Mystery Train" outro) before the tape cuts to "Glory Days".

At least 1/2 of the fans had left, the house lights were up and the roadies were taking lights down. I know because I was 15 years old and sitting in the first row behind the stage.

End of the first leg of the "Born In The U.S.A." tour

1985-01-28 - A&M STUDIOS, HOLLYWOOD, CA

WE ARE THE WORLD

The recording of the vocals of the African relief single and its associated video with nearly every major-selling U.S.A. solo artist of that time present (Madonna and Prince being the often-noted absentees). Most of the artists arrived directly from the American Music Awards gala held nearby earlier in the evening (note: “Dancing In The Dark” won the Best Single award but Bruce didn't attend the ceremony – he flew in from his previous night's gig at the last moment). The session didn't start until very late on the 28 so, technically speaking, most of the events took place in the early hours of January 29. Bruce’s vocal performance is a standout.

Clyde Kaplan sent his recollections of the night to Brucebase, "I was an assistant engineer at A&M Studios from 1981 to 1986, including the night of January 28, 1985, the night of the We Are The World vocal recording sessions. (The track was recorded earlier in the week at Lion's Share Studios.) We had a large studio, Studio A, which was used for the vocal sessions. We also had a large sound stage which had a video feed from the studio as well as food and drinks for the friends and family of the artists. But one of the biggest selling features for A&M was our gated parking lot. Most of the artists came by limo after the American Music Awards and were driven through the gates and dropped off at the studio door. Not Bruce. Bruce had flown in from a show in Syracuse, rented a car and drove himself to A&M. He came in to the control room and I heard him say, "I got a great place to park... right across the street."

A great moment for me was Bruce singing his solo at the end of the song. It was probably 4am. We had just finished Bob Dylan doing his solo. Bruce went to the mic to do his part. From where I was in the control room, my view was Bruce on the left, the microphone on the right, and directly in between and about 10 feet behind, watching, stood Bob Dylan."

The recording and video were released on March 7, 1985.

BORN IN THE U.S.A. / OUT IN THE STREET / DARLINGTON COUNTY / JOHNNY 99 / ATLANTIC CITY / REASON TO BELIEVE / SHUT OUT THE LIGHT / JOHNNY BYE-BYE / PROVE IT ALL NIGHT / GLORY DAYS / THE PROMISED LAND / MY HOMETOWN / TRAPPED / BADLANDS / THUNDER ROAD / COVER ME / DANCING IN THE DARK / HUNGRY HEART / CADILLAC RANCH / DOWNBOUND TRAIN / I'M ON FIRE / PINK CADILLAC / BOBBY JEAN / RACING IN THE STREET / CAN'T HELP FALLING IN LOVE / BORN TO RUN / I'M A ROCKER / RAMROD / DETROIT MEDLEY - TRAVELIN' BAND

Bruce's first ever appearance in Australia. "Johnny Bye-Bye" includes the "Mystery Train" outro. A couple of references to "Saturday night in Sydney" at the end of "Out In The Street" have people confused since March 21 was a Thursday night. Also some people report that Saturday night is mentioned at the end of "Prove It All Night" and also at the start of "Growin' Up" - but the latter track was not played on this night. This setlist is confirmed by a fan present at all five shows. Show length is 3:02 excluding intermission.

Audience tape. A review of the tape reveals no references to "Saturday" at all - obviously people have been listening to one of the LP releases of this series of shows which were compilations of the five-night stand, or had tracks on that were never played in Australia on this tour.

1985-03-22 - SYDNEY ENTERTAINMENT CENTRE, SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA

DOWN BY THE RIVER

To a deafening ovation Bruce casually strolls out and joins Neil Young onstage during the final encore in Neil's final show in Sydney. Bruce and Neil trade vocals and blistering guitar solos on an extended version of Young's 1969 song classic. Nils Lofgren also made a guest appearance earlier in this show, playing piano on "Tell Me Why" and accordion on "Comes A Time". Still rated by many as Bruce's most memorable walk-on guest appearance. First known Springsteen performance of the song.

A very good quality audience recording of this entire show is in circulation via Neil Young fan sources. “Down By The River” is also found on various homemade Young CDR compilations.

1985-03-31 - QEII SPORTS CENTRE, BRISBANE, AUSTRALIA

BORN IN THE U.S.A. / DARLINGTON COUNTY / OUT IN THE STREET / WORKING ON THE HIGHWAY / JOHNNY 99 / ATLANTIC CITY / NEBRASKA / REASON TO BELIEVE / THE RIVER / JOHNNY BYE-BYE / GLORY DAYS / THE PROMISED LAND / BADLANDS / THUNDER ROAD / COVER ME / DANCING IN THE DARK / HUNGRY HEART / CADILLAC RANCH / I’M GOIN’ DOWN / I’M ON FIRE / PINK CADILLAC / BOBBY JEAN / RACING IN THE STREET / CAN’T HELP FALLING IN LOVE / BORN TO RUN / WHO’LL STOP THE RAIN / RAMROD / ROCKIN’ ALL OVER THE WORLD / TWIST AND SHOUT - DO YOU LOVE ME

First ever performances in Australia of "Nebraska", "I'm Goin' Down", and "Who'll Stop The Rain". The only Born In The U.S.A. Tour show that is not circulating on audio and, as such, one that has seen a number of highly speculative setlists make the rounds. Brucebase’s above-mentioned 29-song setlist (and sequencing) is culled from unearthed information in The Brisbane Courier Mail, The Australasian Weekly and the collective (but agreed upon) recollections of several actual Brisbane show attendees. The song placement may not be totally accurate, however. Bruce opened this show with the comment “are you guys ready for a little rock and roll trip”? During "Thunder Road", the final song of the first set, Bruce tried in vain to get the audience to sing some of the lines, prompting him to jokingly comment to the crowd “sounds like you didn’t get this one down here”. Near the end of the show Bruce, peering out at the rain soaked crowd, predicated a rare performance of "Who’ll Stop The Rain" with the comment – “we’re gonna play something especially for you guys on account of the meteorological conditions”. Show attendee Andrzej adds "...the show overall was really underwhelming – I remember "Atlantic City" as it was the only song that I was really impressed by - the venue was waaaay too big and it was the first time I’d heard him describing himself as the ‘Boss’ - it felt like he had reached a point where he was believing the press." A gig marred by poor decisions by both Bruce’s management team and the event promoter. This concert was originally scheduled for the 8,000-seat outdoor Brisbane Chandler Velodrome. However tickets were on sale for only a few days when the venue was suddenly shifted to the expansive 50,000-seat QEII stadium in Nathan, a southern suburb of Brisbane. The concert eventually was a near sellout. The sound system was inadequate for the size of the venue and the stadium’s large video screen was out of synchronization with the audio. Unlike the Sydney shows, a no-alcohol policy was in place for the Brisbane show, a policy that many patrons were unaware of and which the Police strictly enforced - resulting in significant delays getting into the stadium.

No known audio circulates. In addition to the alcohol issue the Brisbane Courier noted over 50 cameras and some 20 recording devices were confiscated from patrons entering the stadium. This probably explains why, even after 20 years, no audience recording is known to exist. A small snippet of local news footage of "Born In The U.S.A." is circulating on video.

A new source was put into circulation from a second generation tape in June 2013 (mjk5510), this verified lineage source confirms 'Rockin' All Over The World' was not played at this show. This source was also released on CD as 'Tokyo 1985 2nd Night (Zion Records)'.

End of the Australia / Japan leg of the "Born In The U.S.A." tour

1985-05-11 - GEMINI PUB, LAKE OSWEGO, OR

HUNGRY HEART / I’M ON FIRE / GLORY DAYS

With a month’s break in the Born In The U.S.A. tour, Bruce joins a small group of friends (including Julianne Phillips’ father and brother) for a proverbial boy’s night out in sleepy Lake Oswego the night before his midnight wedding. Bruce sings a number of songs, karaoke-style, to his own records in the jukebox. Note: some confusion remains about which of the town’s small number of watering holes this actually took place in, contemporary news articles claim Springsteen was at the Firestone Inn.
00News-32.png

1985-05-14 - OSWEGO LAKE COUNTRY CLUB, LAKE OSWEGO, OR

Wedding reception for Bruce and Julianne, delayed until the day after the church wedding in an attempt to outfox the media. Steve Van Zandt and Clarence (who were Bruce’s best men) definitely attended but it is still unclear how many other E Street Band members were present. There was a string quartet hired to play but Bruce (and others) did get up and sing a song or two. Following the reception the honeymooners spent a week or so at Lake Como in Italy, staying in a villa owned by designer Gianni Versace.

1985-05-27 - MAXWELL’S, HOBOKEN, NJ

GLORY DAYS

Bruce & the entire E Street Band gather at this local nightclub (along with “guest stars” Little Steven and Bruce’s new bride Julianne) to film the video for “Glory Days”, with John Sayles directing. Preliminary filming took place on May 24 with Bruce and the band present on the 27th and 28th.

Two or three different scripts were filmed in part, one of which featured the band performing “live” vocals off a backing track – although the one eventually chosen for release has the band merely lip-syncing the standard album/single recording. Neither the “live vocal” audio nor any of the outtake video seems to be in collector circulation.

Start of the European leg of the "Born In The U.S.A." tour

1985-06-01 - SLANE CASTLE, SLANE, IRELAND

BORN IN THE U.S.A. / BADLANDS / OUT IN THE STREET / JOHNNY 99 / ATLANTIC CITY / THE RIVER / WORKING ON THE HIGHWAY / TRAPPED / PROVE IT ALL NIGHT / GLORY DAYS / THE PROMISED LAND / MY HOMETOWN / THUNDER ROAD / COVER ME / DANCING IN THE DARK / HUNGRY HEART / CADILLAC RANCH / DOWNBOUND TRAIN / I'M ON FIRE / PINK CADILLAC / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / WHEN I GROW UP (TO BE A MAN) / BORN TO RUN / BOBBY JEAN / RAMROD / TWIST AND SHOUT - DO YOU LOVE ME

Springsteen’s first ever appearance in Ireland. The actual location was not Dublin (a common error) but the small village of Slane in County Meath, about 30 miles north of the city. Held in the daytime in a picturesque outdoor amphitheatre setting – and the temperature was unseasonably hot! This was the largest crowd Bruce had played to up to this point, with 90,000 to 100,000 in attendance. Prior to the show there was much concern amongst locals that the influx of Springsteen fans would result in disturbances and violence similar to the previous summer when Bob Dylan performed at the same venue. In the event the day passed without any major problems. However Bruce did show some concern for the safety of the crowd during the show, the rhythmic swaying and movement meant there was real danger of crushing at the front. Springsteen was led to make a request for calm before "Johnny 99". News reports suggest that Eric Clapton and Pete Townshend joined Bruce on stage. First appearance of the River Boyne on the big screens during "The River" - this shot would continue to appear on the screens throughout the rest of the tour. Slane Castle overlooks the river. This was Bruce’s first full concert as a married man – consequently the crowd was treated to a special (and still never repeated) performance of the Beach Boys ‘rite-of-passage’ classic “When I Grow Up (To Be A Man)”. "Twist And Shout" features an unusual sung introduction. European debuts for "Born In The U.S.A.", "Johnny 99", "Atlantic City", "Working On The Highway", "Glory Days", "My Hometown", "Cover Me", "Dancing In The Dark", "Downbound Train", "I'm On Fire", "Pink Cadillac", and "Bobby Jean".

Audience tape. Two recording sources circulate, released on LP 'Dancing In Dublin' and the same source in an upgraded tape transfer (cre001). A second very good alternate source circulates from a tape transfer.

Notorious show that led to the stadium requiring serious repairs.

Originally scheduled to take place at Stade De Colombes, the show was moved to Parc de La Courneuve in the wake of a football riot in Brussels. Wary of disturbances, authorities in Paris had created so many security restrictions for Stade De Colombes (a football stadium with a concert capacity of around 50,000) it made more sense to move it to the large green space in the northern suburbs of Paris. First ever performance in France of "Shut Out The Light".

Audience tape, pro-shot video and soundboard audio from the video. Two audience sources circulate. The first is available on the four-LP set 'Live In Paris', a second alternate source entered circulation in December 2013 from a second generation tape transfer (mjk5510), this source does not include "Rockin' All Over The World". It is unconfirmed which source the CDR release 'Parigi 29 06 85' uses. This show has also been released in a complete pro-shot DVD of superb quality entitled 'Breathless In Paris' (Digitox). An excellent representation of a standard Born In The USA Tour show and a must-have for collectors. Soundboard release from the über series on CDR titled 'Breathless In Paris : AUDIO - Uber Series Vol. 17' (Ev2).

End of the European leg of the "Born In The U.S.A." tour

1985-07-00 - SHAKEDOWN STUDIOS, NEW YORK CITY, NY

SUN CITY

Springsteen records his vocal parts for the Little Steven written and co-produced song. Bruce’s cameo appearance on the “Sun City” music video, as well as various interview segments may also have been recorded during this brief break in Born In The U.S.A. tour, although this is unclear. Both the single, its video and a Voices of Sun City promo-only interview LP containing comments by Bruce were first released in early November 1985, with the commercial LP issued in early December. The Steve Lawrence-directed documentary The Making Of Sun City, which contains elements of all of the above plus some additional Springsteen interview footage, was released in early 1986.

"Sherry Darling" includes a couple lines from "Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey!" in the outro for the first time.

Audience tape. Released on CD 'A Night At The Soldierfields' (Pearls Before Swine). Also directly from Rick B's master recording, amazing sound quality and one of the best audience tapes of the tour, titled 'Warm Night In Chicago' (Ev2). Here's some extra info about this show: "This recording is absolutely sick and borderline ridiculous in terms of quality for an audience tape. If you want to hear power captured via digital audio, this is the tape for you. Not sure we could do as well today for some reason and why is that? One trainspotter moment I have called out before from the show is beautifully captured on this tape in the first minute or so of "Born In The U.S.A." As some of you might know, for this tour Max Weinberg switched from miking his drums to using drum triggers to fatten the sound. The drum trigger hits a sampler which plays a commanding "whoomp" sound. When Bruce starts "Born In The U.S.A." in Chicago, Max comes in with those single snare beats, only someone forgot to turn on the drum sampler/triggers. So for the first few bars its like "tick," "tick," "tick" as we only here the miked drum, then someone throws the switch and it's "kaboom," "kaboom," "kaboom." The difference is incredible and you'll hear it here." - Butterking

A bizarre beginning to this concert, as Nils and Roy are playing table tennis in a room adjacent to the dressing room and do not receive their cue that it’s time for the show to begin – resulting in a bemused Bruce starting the show and performing “Born In The U.S.A.” without them. Starting the following show Bruce takes a head count as the band takes the stage, a practice that continues to this very day. "Sherry Darling" includes a snippet of "Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey!" in the outro.

A Brucebase reader present comments "That night, it was insanely hot in Philadelphia, during the day the temperature was well over 100 degrees. By show time it was around 90 degrees. Oh yeah, add in 100% humidity. (I am not exaggerating) Now, Veterans Stadium was a round stadium so the air did not circulate at all. So you can imagine how bad the heat was. To this day, when I watch a video of that show, I start sweating. Anyway, at some point in the encores I believe, Bruce yells out, "I need some air conditioning." Starting at the next tour stop at the Meadowlands in New Jersey, Bruce's road crew rigged cold air blowers from underneath the stage. This was the first time it was ever used. "Sherry Darling" includes a snippet of "Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey!" in the outro.

Audience tape and pro-shot video. Three recording sources circulate, the first is released on CD 'Do You Love Me?' and is a soundtrack rip from the videos, quality is fair at best. The second and third recording sources, both big upgrades, entered into circulation in November 2013 (cre001 - source 2 and mjk5510 - source 3). Pro-shot video footage of the entire concert (apparently taped via the stadium's sky box feed and marred by some serious interference) has been circulating among collectors for quite some time; eventually released (in slightly better picture quality than previous versions) on a factory-pressed DVD called 'Live On The Born In The U.S.A. Tour' on the Watchdog label.

The complete "Johnny 99" (seen in part on the BBC Glory Days documentary broadcast in 1986) and an alternative mix of the "Born To Run" video (without much of the 1985 tour footage) circulate on DVD.

The second source, also from a tape transfer, contains patches from the first source making it complete (Cre001).

1985-08-29 - SULLIVAN STADIUM, FOXBOROUGH, MA

Cancelled concert, never re-scheduled. An application for a concert permit was submitted by the Springsteen camp but later withdrawn due to stringent licensing restrictions. The city required that the application be studied for 21 days and then advertised for two weeks, but a late application meant the requested August 29 date would not be possible. Foxboro imposed the strict regulations when trouble broke out at Police and David Bowie concerts several years previous.

Bruce flubs the words to the first verse of "Downbound Train". Creedence Clearwater Revival's "Travelin' Band" is added in the encores in response to an artificial leg being thrown on stage - "...this man just took off his leg, wait a minute (chuckles)....hold it on up, man.....wait a second....this man took that last song too literally....but he gets a song....´Travelin' Band´, key of E, ´Travelin' Band´....”.

Audience tape. Two recording sources available, released on CDR "The Seeds We've Sown In Dallas. A second, much improved source, is available from mjk5510's audience masters (start of "Born In The U.S.A." is cut).

This concert (and the next night) took place at the large outdoor Coliseum - previous shows in Oakland in 1980 and 1984 have taken place at the smaller indoor Arena. Both Coliseum and Arena are part of the large Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum complex.

Audience tape. Two recording sources available with one being Mark Persic's master tape. Incredible sound quality on CDR 'The Shadow Of A Dream' (Ev2) (Persic's tape).

As Bruce says during the show: "We´ll do some different stuff" - that's what they did, as setlist includes very rare 1985 renditions of "Highway Patrolman" (where Bruce forgets the words and starts again) and "Used Cars". A pretty amusing event also right before "Used Cars" as Bruce has to tell Danny to get the accordion for the song. "Growin' Up" features the bear story. One of the best audience taped back-to-back show combinations as both (this and previous night's show) are in exceptional sound quality.

Audience tape. Available from Mark Persic's master tapes, "The Best Of Absolutely Everything", (Ev2).

"Cadillac Ranch" includes the "Land Of A 1000 Dances" chant in the introduction. One of the main source concerts for the official Live/1975-85 box set, which included a total of eight recordings (“Born In The U.S.A.”, “Darlington County”, “Seeds”, “The River”, “War” (with overdubbed Nils Lofgren guitar solo), “The Promised Land”, “My Hometown” and “Cover Me”) from this show. In addition, “My Hometown” and “War” were later released as video clips, and also included on the Video Anthology VHS/DVD.

Audience tape. Two recording sources circulate, the first is available from Mark Persic's master recording, which is also used for remaster 'The Promised Night' (Ev2). A second source (damien) was released as 'Blind Faith (Erno). EV2's 'The Promised Night' uses "Born In The U.S.A." from the 'damien' source due to over recording on the Persic source as well as patches to four songs. Persic's audience recording suffers from occasional loud crowd interference but is still an upgrade over any previous recording of this great show. Several pro-shot clips from this show also circulate apart from the official videos - "Born In The U.S.A.", "Darkness On The Edge Of Town", "Seeds", "The Promised Land", "Cadillac Ranch", "Thunder Road", "This Land Is Your Land" and "No Surrender". Most are sourced from the 1986 BBC documentary Glory Days. The complete "This Land Is Your Land" (including spoken introduction) was broadcast on ABC's 20/20.

1986-01-19 - THE STONE PONY, ASBURY PARK, NJ

MY HOMETOWN / THE PROMISED LAND / BADLANDS / DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN / STAND ON IT / RAMROD / TWIST AND SHOUT

'Jam '86 Hometown Benefit' for the 3M Plant in Freehold with the full E Street Band, minus Nils Lofgren and Roy Bittan. On the audience tape, the big question is: “Is it Bruce or is it the taper?” and most of the time it’s the taper. On the other hand, he is in a fine voice and a die hard fan who knows all the lyrics. On a more serious note: the show includes a unique “Stand On It” with a saxophone solo in the middle.

Audience tape. Filmed by ABC and clips are broadcast on 20/20.

1986-02-00 - THE STONE PONY, ASBURY PARK, NJ

Rehearsals for the play “Lady Beth” put on by the out of work 3M workers from the plant in Freehold. Bruce attends the rehearsals and decides to fund the endeavours of the workers in putting on the play.

1986-02-00 - SHOREFIRE STUDIOS, LONG BRANCH, NJ

WE’VE GOT THE LOVE

With Garry Tallent and Tim Ryan producing, Bruce Springsteen records a lead guitar solo for this multi-artist charity recording, part of a forthcoming Jersey Artists For Mankind (‘JAM’) release to fight global hunger.

The 7" single was released on May 16th 1986 and 12" extended mix versions (also with Bruce’s guitar part present) a couple of weeks later. The video for the track was filmed on April 26-27, 1986 in Red Bank, NJ and featured most of those heard on the record with the notable exception of Springsteen.

STAND ON IT / WORKING ON THE HIGHWAY / DARLINGTON COUNTY / THE PROMISED LAND / DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN / I'M GOIN' DOWN / MY HOMETOWN / CADILLAC RANCH / GLORY DAYS

Bruce and the full E Street Band, except Roy Bittan. Once again a special “Stand On It”, this time with the saxophone solo at the end. “The Promised Land” has a unique guitar solo at the end, most likely courtesy our man. “I’m Goin’ Down” has lengthy guitar work from Bruce and Nils Lofgren from the middle until Clarence Clemons does his solo at the end.

1986-05-29 - EAST FREEHOLD PARK, FREEHOLD, NJ

Cancelled concert, never re-scheduled. This was to have been the Jersey Artists For Mankind outdoor benefit to promote the May 16 release of the “JAM" single. Despite the fact that neither Springsteen or any E Street Band members were promoted or billed for the show, rumors began circulating in mid April that Bruce was going to show up and play, which saw town officials revoke the organizers concert permit on April 22. The Park could only accommodate 12,000 and there were fears that, even without tickets, 100,000 people might turn up in sleepy Freehold once the Springsteen rumor spread widely. As it was revealed much later, Bruce had not committed to perform - but had not ruled it out either and was leaning towards making an appearance if things could be kept under wraps. They couldn’t.
00Photo-32.png

1986-09-26 - THE STONE PONY, ASBURY PARK, NJ

Bruce is in the audience at a play (“Lady Beth”) at the Stone Pony. This play was put on by out-of-work 3M workers from the plant in Freehold. Bruce gets up on stage and gives a speech and poses with the play’s performers.

Video footage of this event is on the "This Is Your Life" DVD set.


1986-10-00 - WNET STUDIOS, NEW YORK CITY, NY

Director Hart Perry films interviews with Springsteen and John Hammond (both separately and together), as part of a work-in-progress documentary about the career of Hammond. This was early in the film’s production schedule. However the untimely death of Hammond in October 1987 ended up causing a delay in the completion of the project.

John Hammond: From Bessie Smith to Bruce Springsteen was first broadcast (via PBS stations across the U.S.A.) on August 20, 1990. It was later released commercially in various formats. Much of the late 1986 Springsteen film footage (allegedly including a solo, acoustic song performance ultimately not utilized in the documentary) remains in the vault. A brief audio snippet of Springsteen singing “Forever Young” at Hammond’s October 22, 1987 funeral (see Brucebase listing) can be heard over the film’s closing credits.

Post show: (ALL I CAN DO IS) DREAM YOU / THE COMEDIANS / CANDY MAN / CLAUDETTE / UPTOWN

Bruce (and others) join Roy Orbison for the filming of Roy Orbison & Friends: A Black & White Night, shot in beautiful black and white and broadcast on Cinemax in January 1988. The film is shot in the Cocoanut Grove, a nightclub in the now-torn-down Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. Orbison's cover of Elvis Costello's "The Comedians" requires three takes. Bruce plays guitar and shares vocals with Roy on "Dream Baby (How Long Must I Dream)", and he also plays guitar on the rest of the songs (sitting on a chair behind Roy on the stage). Backing group is the TCB Band (who accompanied Elvis Presley between 1969-77) including James Burton, who exchanges guitar solos with Springsteen during the show-stopping "Oh, Pretty Woman". This particular performance won the 1991 Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance. Bruce Springsteen, Jackson Browne, Elvis Costello, T Bone Burnett (who also acts as musical director), J.D. Souther, Jennifer Warnes, k.d. lang, Bonnie Raitt, Tom Waits... can we consider that an "all-star lineup"? Yeah, let's.

The resulting film is later released on Roy Orbison & Friends, A Black & White Night (abbreviated to Black & White Night for the HD-DVD and Blu-ray releases) on multiple formats, including VHS, LaserDisc, DVD and in high definition on Blu-ray. Subsequently, an audio CD titled A Black & White Night Live is released in 1989. "Blue Angel" is cut from the television broadcast for time, along with "Claudette" and "Blue Bayou". However, the song is included as a bonus track on the HD-DVD and Blu-ray releases.

To celebrate the 30th anniversary of the concert Black & White Night 30 will be released on February 24, 2017 on CD/DVD and CD/Blu-ray. The film has been completely re-edited and the concert restored to the correct order, which is represented in the setlist above. The set also includes a five-song "secret concert" performed by the full band after the show had ended, with no audience. Shooting only stopped after film ran out during "Claudette". Rehearsal footage and pre- and post-show interviews are also included.

1987-10-08 - FORT HANCOCK, SANDY HOOK, NJ

BRILLIANT DISGUISE

Film shooting by Springsteen and Director Meiert Avis for the video single of “Brilliant Disguise”. For this video Springsteen performed twenty-four takes of a new “live” vocal over the regular album instrumental backing track to the song. The shoot was moved to the mothballed army base at the last minute because the original location (a rented residential kitchen) was unavailable. Meiert Avis has a fascinating article on his website about the video that is a must-read.

STAND ON IT / GLORY DAYS / BAD MOON RISING / AROUND AND AROUND / BRILLIANT DISGUISE / TOUGHER THAN THE REST / LIGHT OF DAY / BORN TO RUN / FORTUNATE SON / TWO FACES / LUCILLE / TWIST AND SHOUT

Full Band except Nils Lofgren and Clarence Clemons. Premieres of "Brilliant Disguise", "Tougher Than The Rest", and "Two Faces", as well as the first acoustic "Born To Run". “Tougher Than The Rest” is close to the recorded version, faster and without the harmonica solos seen on the Tunnel Of Love Express Tour. “Born To Run” omits the harmonica solo played on the tour. "Lucille" includes a snippet of "Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey!". There was another band playing at McLoone's on this night, and very few people got word that Bruce was going to show up but they went to the bar which was already packed, as it was Halloween, and in some cases snuck in as there was no more legal room. Well, the band came in all dressed in black and with masks on. They hit the stage and pulled off their masks and, after throwing the other band off, played the above listed set. The guy who was the lead guitarist in the displaced band jumped off stage grabbed a camera that he luckily had with him and shot some pictures.

1987-11-17 - PALACE AMUSEMENTS, ASBURY PARK, NJ

TUNNEL OF LOVE

On-location film shooting by Springsteen and Director Meiert Avis for the video single of “Tunnel Of Love”. Location shooting started on the 16th and finished on the 17th. Note: During the shoot Springsteen was given a tour of the Asbury Park Rock and Roll Museum (then-located in the Palace complex) by its co-owner, Billy Smith.

The video single was released in early 1988 and is a mixture of lip synched and conceptual footage. An alternate version of the video was produced that was never released and it allegedly features less conceptual footage and more emphasis on Springsteen.

TWIST AND SHOUT / I SAW HER STANDING THERE / BORN ON THE BAYOU / (I CAN’T GET NO) SATISFACTION / LIKE A ROLLING STONE / ALL ALONG THE WATCHTOWER

Springsteen attends the third Annual Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame ceremonies with Bob Dylan, The Beatles and The Beach Boys the evening’s key Hall Of Fame inductees. This 1988 event is considered to be the most memorable to date due to the number of major stars that turned up. Bruce gives the induction speech for Dylan. Springsteen performed in varying musician/vocalist support roles on all of the above-mentioned tracks. Bruce attended the event with then-wife Julianne Phillips - it was the last time they were seen in public together. The group singing backup on most of the songs, credited on the aforementioned compilation as The Rock Hall Jam Band, includes, among others, Ben E. King, Johnny Moore, Joe Blunt, Clyde Brown, Jeff Beck, George Harrison, Mick Jagger, John and Tom Fogerty, Billy Joel, Bob Dylan, Les Paul, Mary Wilson, Elton John, Arlo Guthrie, Yoko Ono, Ringo Starr, The Beach Boys, Little Richard, Peter Wolf, Neil Young, Paul Simon, Dave Edmunds, Jeff Lynne, Julian Lennon, Sean Lennon, and The World's Most Dangerous Band. Also on stage are various E-Streeters, including Max Weinberg, Little Steven, Clarence Clemons, and Patti Scialfa. Joel sings lead on "I Saw Her Standing There". Fogerty sings lead on "Born On The Bayou". Jagger sings lead on "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction", calling Bruce over to share the microphone. Dylan sings lead on "Like A Rolling Stone", and Harrison and Dylan share vocals on "All Along The Watchtower".

Audio of "I Saw Her Standing There" and "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction" was officially released on the 2011 iTunes compilation Best of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame + Museum Live and later that year on the compilation album Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Vol. 1: 1986-1991 (Live).

1988-01-24 - EXPO THEATER, FORT MONMOUTH, NJ

No set details known. Private E Street Band rehearsals for the Tunnel Of Love Express Tour. All rehearsals were conducted at the U.S. Military base in the town of Fort Monmouth. Confusion has surrounded the location of these rehearsals due to the fact that the military base actually encompasses parts of the towns of Eatontown and Oceanport, as well as the town of Fort Monmouth.

Private rehearsals with the E Street Band (and Horns of Love) for the upcoming Tunnel Of Love Express Tour. The only known rehearsal or live performance to date of "Protection", as well as a one-off but incomplete rendition of The Four Tops’ "Something About You".

Despite the privacy of the event the above-mentioned setlist is culled from an 86-minute audience tape of only fair quality. "I'm On Fire", "One Step Up", "Valentine's Day", "When You're Alone", "From Small Things", "For You" and "Born in the USA" can be found on the CDs 'From Small Things' (Kiss The Stone) and 'When You're Alone' (On Stage Records). The complete audio can now be found on the two-CD set 'The Complete Tunnel Rehearsals' (transferred from an unknown generation tape), or via other home made sources.

1988-02-00 - EXPO THEATER, FORT MONMOUTH, NJ

I AIN’T GOT NO HOME / I AIN’T GOT NO HOME / VIGILANTE MAN / VIGILANTE MAN

Recording (in a “live” rehearsal setting), as well as filming (by director Jim Brown) of two Woody Guthrie-penned songs for the upcoming charity album and PBS film documentary A Vision Shared: Tribute To Woody Guthrie And Leadbelly. All four performances (above) were audio recorded. The second version of each song (above) was filmed on the stage of the Expo Theater – it is unclear if the first version of each song was filmed (they have never circulated). The audio of the first version of each of the two songs (above) was first released on August 24, 1988 on the commercially available A Vision Shared charity album. The audio of the second version of each of the two songs (above) was released in very limited quantity in late September 1988 on a rare, U.S.A.-only, promotional-only soundtrack album for the forthcoming film documentary. That documentary had its world debut airing on October 3, 1988 on the U.S.A.’s national PBS TV network and was later made commercially available in several video formats. Note: this audio/video shoot may have taken place over two days, not one.


1988-02-15 - WONDER BAR, ASBURY PARK, NJ

ONE STEP UP

Filming of conceptual footage for the single release of “One Step Up”. Part of this shoot featured Springsteen made up to look like an older man. This footage was then intermixed with mimed footage of Bruce singing the song that had been filmed at Expo Theater in Fort Monmouth, NJ during one of the Tunnel Of Love Express Tour rehearsals in early February. The video clip was directed by Meiert Avis.

Live debuts of "Tunnel Of Love", "All That Heaven Will Allow", "Roulette", "Spare Parts", "I'm A Coward", "One Step Up", "Part Man, Part Monkey", "Walk Like A Man", plus the first ever on-tour renditions of "Two Faces", "Brilliant Disguise", "Tougher Than The Rest", and "Light Of Day", along with "Be True", which has had only one other public outing before. Premiere of the alternative arrangement of "You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)". This rockabilly style arrangement was included on The Ties That Bind, the unreleased 1979 single album. "Spare Parts" include a highly personal and different introduction story than on later shows – a must-hear. "Part Man, Part Monkey" includes "Love Is Strange" in the outro. "Walk Like A Man" includes a beautiful instrumental intro, played only once more, two shows later. "Born To Run" is solo acoustic. "Roulette" and "Cover Me" in the soundcheck are just the instrumental intros, rehearsed a few times each; the first "Part Man, Part Monkey" is just the ending, with the "Love Is Strange" snippet, while the second, full version also includes "Love Is Strange". The final "Walk Like A Man" in the soundcheck is just the intro.

Audience tape and partial DVD. Available on CDR 'Worcester 88' . A new version from Mark Persic's master recording is now circulating with slightly better sound that on previous recordings of this show. This release includes the complete show unlike the 'First Date' boot - 'Heart Attack On The First Night' (Ev2). Some pro-shot footage (mostly short snippets, but also including a near-complete “Brilliant Disguise”) supposedly shot by a local TV news crew is circulating among collectors. Second half of the show is also filmed from the audience. Soundboard recording of the soundcheck circulates.

Same set as the previous night with the addition of "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out" in the encores. "Part Man, Part Monkey" includes "Love Is Strange" in the outro. This show is the first show without the keyboard intro for "Walk Like A Man". The next night's show has the intro for the second and last time. Bruce forgets the opening lyrics to “Born To Run”, which is solo acoustic, at this show; starting with “In the day we sweat it...” before pausing and saying, “Sung it so damn much I forgot what the first words were!”

Audience tape. Three recording sources circulate, the first is released on double CD 'Tunnel Of Lust' on the Swinging Pig label (incomplete, minus encores as well as a few other tracks) and in complete form from the same source on the three-LP vinyl bootleg 'Express', which was made up to look like an official CBS promo release. A second complete source in good quality circulates on CDR from Mark Persic's master recording, titled 'Broke, Busted & Disgusted' (Ev2). A third source of good quality was put into circulation in March 2015 from first generation tapes (mjk5510).

"Love Me Tender" is premiered. "Part Man, Part Monkey" includes "Love Is Strange" in the outro. The keyboard intro to "Walk Like A Man" played at the first show of the tour is played again for the second and final time. "Born To Run" is solo acoustic.

Audience tape. Four recording sources circulate, the first is from Mark Persic's master tapes and is excellent quality but contains distortion in places. A second high quality source was put into circulation from first generation tapes in March 2015 (mjk5510), this source misses from Detroit Medley to the end and is patched with the third recording source. A third recording source was put into circulation from second generation tapes in March 2015 (mjk5510), this source is complete with only a splice at the end of "Cover Me". A fourth source of lesser quality than the previous three sources is in limited circulation.

"Cover Me" includes "Gimme Shelter" for the first time. Bruce removes a fan that jumps on stage during "She's The One". "Part Man, Part Monkey" includes"Love Is Strange" in the outro. "Born To Run" is solo acoustic. First show at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum since the famous three show stand in December 1980.

Audience tape, three recording sources are available. On the first source "Detroit Medley" is cut and "Raise Your Hand" is missing. The second source is circulating from a first generation tape and missing "Love Me Tender" (mjk5510). This source utilises patches (including "Love Me Tender" from the first recording source) to form the complete show. The third, and easily the best quality source entered circulation in 2013 from the master tapes (Hobbes4444). Two short patches of six seconds each at the beginning of "Roulette" and "Cover Me" make this tape complete and the one to seek out. Show has been released on CDR 'Boom Boom' but it is uncertain which source that release uses. Parts of the show are available on a good quality DVD shot from behind the stage, providing an almost unique view.

Audience tape, and video of some of the show shot from left hand side of stage - available on DVD. Best audience tape is from Mark Persic's master recording.

Soundcheck: JUNGLELAND / MAN AT THE TOP / I'M SO LONESOME I COULD CRY

Pre-set: CRYING

TUNNEL OF LOVE / BE TRUE / ADAM RAISED A CAIN / TWO FACES / ALL THAT HEAVEN WILL ALLOW / SEEDS / ROULETTE / COVER ME / BRILLIANT DISGUISE / SPARE PARTS / WAR / BORN IN THE U.S.A. / TOUGHER THAN THE REST / AIN'T GOT YOU - SHE'S THE ONE / YOU CAN LOOK (BUT YOU BETTER NOT TOUCH) / I'M A COWARD / I'M ON FIRE / ONE STEP UP / PART MAN, PART MONKEY / BACKSTREETS / DANCING IN THE DARK / LIGHT OF DAY / BORN TO RUN / HUNGRY HEART / GLORY DAYS / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT) / HAVE LOVE WILL TRAVEL / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT / SWEET SOUL MUSIC / RAISE YOUR HAND / LITTLE LATIN LUPE LU / TWIST AND SHOUT

Longest and one of the best of the Tunnel Of Love Express Tour shows. A few show notes, most of which can be also said for all shows this leg: "Two Faces" includes a nice guitar intro, "All That Heaven Will Allow" has a lengthy intro story, "Cover Me" includes "Gimme Shelter" in the outro, "Spare Parts" has the usual intro about love gone bad, and "You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)" is rearranged much like the rockabilly version contemplated for the unreleased The Ties That Bind album in 1979, but with a story included. "I’m A Coward" has a long intro story and "Part Man, Part Monkey" includes "Love Is Strange in the outro. Adele is invited to dance with Bruce during "Dancing In The Dark". "Born To Run" is solo acoustic. A unique “Little Latin Lupe Lu” for the tour and a first since Boston, March 25, 1977. Audience tape of the soundcheck includes "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry" and "Crying". Backstreets Magazine also reports Roy playing a piece of "Jungleland" and Nils singing "Man At The Top". Clarence's son singing a couple lines after "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry". Bruce allows a few hundred people in early who had been in line since noon to hear the last song of the soundcheck, Roy Orbison's "Crying". Brucebase has previously also listed "Big Boss Man" as being soundchecked, but this has been retracted pending verification. Please get in touch if you have further information regarding the soundcheck.

Audience tape, video feed and audience-shot video. The audio portion of the video feed is released on CD 'Roses And Broken Hearts' (Great Dane Records) and re-released on the Gamble Records label. This recording is clear, but somewhat flat. An audience recording (from Mark Persic's master tapes) also circulates directly from the master tapes and remastered as 'The Longest Date' (Ev2), it is superior to the line feed in many respects. The video recording is believed to exist in the hands of some collectors. Audience-shot video available on DVD from JEMS/Brucevideos.

"Roulette" is dropped for the first time this tour, replaced with "Darkness On The Edge Of Town" which is played for the fourth and final time this tour. "Cover Me" includes "Gimme Shelter" in the outro, "Part Man, Part Monkey" includes "Love Is Strange" in the outro, "Light of Day" includes "Born To Be Wild" in the center section. "Dancing In The Dark" is not played. "Born To Run" is solo acoustic. The soundcheck includes Slim Harpo's "Rainin' In My Heart" (not the Buddy Holly song with the same title), "Big Boss Man" (first recorded by Jimmy Reed but also by Elvis Presley), "Let It Be Me" (The Everly Brothers, also soundchecked in Atlanta in March) with Nils taking lead vocals, "Cathy's Clown" and "Crying In The Rain" (both also The Everly Brothers) and both "Rock And Roll Music" and "Sweet Little Sixteen" by Chuck Berry. The second song of the soundcheck has historically been titled "The Way You Walk", however a little investigation has revealed it to be John Lee Hooker's "Dimples". Perhaps Bruce had considered including the song in the Express Tour set, but instead settled on "Boom Boom" which will be premiered four days after this show in Bloomington, MN.

Premiere of "Cautious Man", and the only known appearance until the Devils & Dust Tour in 2005 - the song was played in the soundchecks earlier. Debut of "Boom Boom". “Two Faces” has a nice guitar intro again. “Spare Parts” does not have an intro story, for a change, but “All That Heaven Will Allow”, “You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)” and “I’m A Coward” all include intro stories, as always. "Part Man, Part Monkey" includes "Love Is Strange" in the outro. "Light Of Day" fades out midway. "Born To Run" is solo acoustic. This show is the source of an urban legend when it was reported that the origins of the song "Boom Boom" being played was a riff played on the bass, followed by all the band spontaneously joining in and playing the song for the first time ever. Well apart from the two soundcheck versions anyway.

Audience tape available on CD 'Bloomington Night' (Crystal Cat).

RECONSIDER BABY / BOOM BOOM / ? / ? / ? / ?

Bruce and Nils Lofgren sit and listen to a few songs by the New Orleans Blues Department, a loose collection of local musicians. After the first set guitarist/vocalist Michael Sklar approaches Springsteen and invites him to join the band during the second set. Bruce accepts, and Sklar drives home and returns with a spare Stratocaster and amp. Springsteen then joins the N.O.B.D on Lowell Fulson's "Reconsider Baby". After a break Nils borrows Sklar's guitar for "Boom Boom" and four other unidentified R&B classics. Springsteen returned to the Maple Leaf Bar in 1992 to play with The Iguanas.

BADLANDS / OUT IN THE STREET / BOOM BOOM / ADAM RAISED A CAIN / ALL THAT HEAVEN WILL ALLOW / THE RIVER / COVER ME / BRILLIANT DISGUISE / THE PROMISED LAND / SPARE PARTS / WAR / BORN IN THE U.S.A. / CHIMES OF FREEDOM / PARADISE BY THE "C" / WHO DO YOU LOVE? - SHE'S THE ONE / YOU CAN LOOK (BUT YOU BETTER NOT TOUCH) / I'M A COWARD / I'M ON FIRE / DOWNBOUND TRAIN / BECAUSE THE NIGHT / DANCING IN THE DARK / LIGHT OF DAY - LAND OF 1000 DANCES / BORN TO RUN / HUNGRY HEART / GLORY DAYS / CAN'T HELP FALLING IN LOVE / BOBBY JEAN / CADILLAC RANCH / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT / SWEET SOUL MUSIC / TWIST AND SHOUT - HAVING A PARTY

"Out in the Street" and "The Promised Land" make their tour debuts and "Born to Run" is performed with the full band for the first time on the tour. "Adam Raised A Cain" includes "Hoochie Coochie Man" and "I'm A Man" in the outro. "Cover Me" includes "Gimme Shelter" in the outro. "You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)" includes the sung "Don't You Touch That Thing" intro. "Dancing In The Dark" includes "Lookin' For A Love" in the outro. Oddly, this show was announced by the promoters as a "Concert for Nicaragua" (see ticket stub), which upset Bruce and prompted him to give his infamous German-language speech prior to "Chimes Of Freedom" about "not being here for or against any certain government, but to play rock ’n’ roll for (you) East Berliners...in the hope that one day, all barriers will be torn down." A few minutes before the concert started, Bruce had the words translated and written down in phonetic spelling by his personal German driver, George Kerwinski, and the speech originally included the word "walls" instead of "barriers" – this was changed at the proverbial last minute because it was (rightly) considered too delicate by Jon Landau. Kerwinski had to literally climb onstage during the show and tell Bruce to say "barrier". Bruce does his introduction in German while the band plays in the background. Of course, the entire speech was censored in the original East German television and radio broadcasts anyway, although it was shown on various TV news reports in West Germany.

Audience tape and radio/television broadcast. Bruce's first ever appearance in East Germany. This show is partially broadcast on East German television and radio. The original broadcast footage was released on a factory-pressed DVD entitled 'Behind The Wall' on the Bossvideo Ltd. label. A mixture of the radio broadcast and audience tape is available as 'Rocking The Badlands'. The original broadcast of the concert did not include "Out In The Street" and "Boom Boom" - they were only shown on later re-broadcasts.

1988-08-03 - CAMP NOU, BARCELONA, SPAIN

TUNNEL OF LOVE / BOOM BOOM / ADAM RAISED A CAIN / DOWNBOUND TRAIN / ALL THAT HEAVEN WILL ALLOW / THE RIVER / BADLANDS / COVER ME / BRILLIANT DISGUISE / SPARE PARTS / WAR / BORN IN THE U.S.A. / CHIMES OF FREEDOM / THUNDER ROAD / WHO DO YOU LOVE? - SHE'S THE ONE / YOU CAN LOOK (BUT YOU BETTER NOT TOUCH) / I'M A COWARD / I'M ON FIRE / TOUGHER THAN THE REST / WORKING ON THE HIGHWAY / DANCING IN THE DARK / LIGHT OF DAY- LAND OF 1000 DANCES / BORN TO RUN / HUNGRY HEART / GLORY DAYS / CAN'T HELP FALLING IN LOVE / BOBBY JEAN / CADILLAC RANCH / SWEET SOUL MUSIC / RAISE YOUR HAND / TWIST AND SHOUT - HAVING A PARTY

During the intro to "Tunnel of Love", Bruce speaks in Catalan, saying, "Hola Barcelona, ja soc aquí" (Hello Barcelona, I'm finally here). This was important to the audience because these are the exact words ("Ja soc aquí") that Catalonian President Josep Tarradellas said on October 23, 1977, when he returned to Barcelona after 38 years in exile because of Franco's dictatorship in Spain. Once democracy was restored in Spain in 1975, the old Generalitat government functioned again (Catalonia's own autonomic government), and Tarradellas came back to take the presidency again. So Bruce saying those magic words was very exciting, and sure he had some good advice about this before the show. "Adam Raised A Cain" includes "I'm A Man" in the outro. "Cover Me" includes "Gimme Shelter" in the outro. "You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)" includes the sung "Don't You Touch That Thing" intro. "Dancing In The Dark" includes "Lookin' For A Love" in the outro. "Light Of Day" includes "Land Of 1000 Dances". "Born To Run" is full band once again. The sleeve for a Spanish promotion-only 7“ single of “Tougher Than The Rest” lists this concert with a date of August 4, so the show may have been rescheduled. A typo is perhaps more likely.

Audience tape and DVD. The final Tunnel Of Love Express Tour show. First ever performance in Spain of "Working On The Highway". Released on CDR 'From Barcelona With Love'. Concert is filmed from the audience, and is available on DVD. Some pro-shot video footage of “Tunnel Of Love”, “Boom Boom” and “Born In The U.S.A.” from this concert was shown on Spanish television. The pro-shot film was broadcast in Barcelona by TV2 as part of a special 20-minute feature. It also included live audio (not video) of "Badlands".

Other than Springsteen, the concerts feature Sting, Peter Gabriel, Tracy Chapman, and Youssou N'Dour, plus guest performers from each of the countries where the concerts are held. The days proceedings begin at around 4pm with a stripped-down version of "Get Up, Stand Up" performed by Springsteen, Gabriel, Chapman, Sting and N'Dour - the first ever Springsteen performance of the song. It is uncertain (but assumed) whether all the shows on the tour featured this opening - please get in touch if you know more. After the introduction and sets by the other performers, Springsteen and the E Street Band play a 15-song set, featuring the first (and only) "Spare Parts" without the horns and the familiar piano/spoken introduction. "Born To Run" is the full band version, as it will be throughout the tour. "Chimes Of Freedom" and a full-band "Get Up, Stand Up" close the show.

Audience tape released on CDR 'Londra 88' and partial (75 minute) screenshot video, which is available on DVD. Three different recording sources circulate with the best source coming from a set of master cassettes that surfaced in 2012 (quick45) that has the end of "Born To Run" cut.

First time that Springsteen has played in Africa. Bruce's only performance in Zimbabwe to date. A certain amount of controversy surrounds this show, played at a Chinese-built sports stadium in the Zimbabwean capital. Reports suggest that Zimbabwe issued an estimated 20,000 visas to South Africans, and the end result is that perhaps 80 percent of the crowd is white. Secondly, the local promoter sourced the sound system from South Africa, which is still in the grips of apartheid. The performers discovered this while in India, protested, and as a result the promoter is forced to locate another system from elsewhere. Generally, it could be said that the show is a success, however at midnight (during Springsteen's set) the stadium lights are switched on, compelling thousands of the vast crowd to head for the exits and ensuring that the show closes with a bit of a whimper. Guest artists are Zimbabwean musician Oliver Mtukudzi, Ilanga, and Cde Chinx.

Audience tape exists but does not currently circulate amongst collectors.

1988-10-14 - ESTADIO MUNDIALISTA MENDOZA, MENDOZA, ARGENTINA

Pre-set: GET UP, STAND UP (with Sting, Peter Gabriel, Tracy Chapman and Youssou N'Dour)

THE RIVER

"The River" was played, but there is no known audience recording of the show. Bruce's first ever appearance in Argentina. Bruce at some point of the show said this to the crowd: " la lucha con coraje de los chilenos y argentinos por la democracia es un ejemplo para el mundo". A translation of this is "The fight with courage from Chile and Argentinos people for the democracy it's an example for all over the world." 30,000 people were at the show, and half of them were from Chile. They crossed the border to see the show. About 1650 policemen were at the show, and checked one by one all the persons who attended. Two Chilean bands recently returned from exile, Los Prisioneros and Inti-Illimani, took part in the show, as did the Mendozino group Markama. A further translation of Springsteen's speech is: "No one knows better than the South Americans how weak are that kind of rights. We fight in order to create one world without Somoza without Pinochet and with no leaders who rule the world with blood from their Countries in their hands. Let's join our voices in order to that the freedon scream will feel strong in America and in all the world."

Parts are broadcast on Chile TV (Television Nacional De Chile) although it is unclear if Bruce's performance was on the broadcast.

Last show of the Amnesty Tour broadcast worldwide live on the radio. David Sancious guests on "Cadillac Ranch", all four artists join Bruce not only for "Chimes Of Freedom" and "Get Up, Stand Up", but also for "Twist And Shout". The local guest artists are León Gieco and Charly García. "Cover Me" is played as on the Born In The U.S.A. album and "I'm On Fire" is without the keyboard introduction heard at the end of the Born In The U.S.A. Tour. "The River" is once again a duet with Sting and includes L. Shankar on the violin. "My Hometown" again has the beautiful keyboard introduction. "Dancing In The Dark" includes a snippet of "Lookin' For A Love" in the outro. Branford Marsalis plays saxophone on "Raise Your Hand" and "Twist And Shout". Before their set, Bruce, Roy, Nils, and Clarence join Sting's band for "Every Breath You Take".

Segments were broadcast as part of a documentary on HBO in the U.S. and other channels around the world later in the year. Portions of the show are officially available on CD, DVD and Blu-ray iReleased! - The Human Rights Concerts 1986-1998, including "Every Breath You Take" with Sting, "Born In The U.S.A.", "The River" and the encores. Available on CDR 'Buenos Aires 88'. Springsteen's complete set is now available on DVD. Note that "Born To Run" was not performed at this show. After the show a local Buenos Aires radio station broadcast (illegally) the radio broadcast of the concert with "Born To Run" added, apparently sourced from the official Live 1975-85 box set. It is a recording of this radio broadcast which circulates on many CD bootlegs.

1989-01-18 - WALDORF-ASTORIA HOTEL, NEW YORK CITY, NY

UPTIGHT (EVERYTHING'S ALRIGHT) / (I CAN'T GET NO) SATISFACTION / AIN'T TOO PROUD TO BEG / LUCILLE / RESPECT / COME SOFTLY TO ME / BE MY BABY / THE WANDERER / MY GIRL / GET READY / HONKY TONK WOMEN / I CAN'T TURN YOU LOOSE / BONY MORONIE / START ME UP / CRYING / RIVER DEEP-MOUNTAIN HIGH / UNDER MY THUMB (instrumental)

Springsteen attends the fourth Annual Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame ceremonies. The night's inductees are Dion, Otis Redding, The Rolling Stones, The Temptations, Stevie Wonder, and Phil Spector, plus The Ink Spots, Bessie Smith, and The Soul Stirrers in the Early Influences category. As had been the case in January 1987 (when Bruce inducted Roy Orbison and performed) and January 1988 (when Bruce inducted Bob Dylan and performed) Springsteen took the stage, joining in the all-star jam on most of the songs and sings lead on “Crying”, dedicated to Roy Orbison, who had passed away only a few weeks earlier. Bruce plays guitar on all songs, plus tambourine on "Uptight (Everything's Alright)". The all-star band includes, along with Bruce, most of The Rolling Stones (Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Ronnie Wood, and Mick Taylor), most of The Temptations (Dennis Edwards, Melvin Franklin, David Ruffin, and Otis Williams), Stevie Wonder, Tina Turner, Little Richard, Pete Townshend, Dion, Paul Simon, Lou Reed, Anita Baker, David Crosby, Graham Nash, Bobby Womack, Al Green, Ben E. King, Bobby McFerrin, Daryl Hall & John Oates, Foreigner's Mick Jones, and more. The house band behind this array of stars is The World's Most Dangerous Band, featuring Paul Shaffer (keyboards), Sid McGinnis (guitar), Will Lee (bass), Tom Malone (trombone, saxophone), Bruce Kapler (saxophone), Alan Cheznovitz (trumpet), and Anton Fig (drums). Bruce attended with Patti Scialfa and, according to some reports, former Castiles member George Theiss attended. Former E Streeter Band member Vini Lopez was definitely there and took part in the show. He later recalled "They had the whole induction ceremony and four hours later, Bill Graham is on stage and he's pulling people out of the audience. Bruce comes up to me and says, 'You see that other drum set up there?' Next thing you know, I was up there. I played for an hour and a half with those guys. Paul Simon, Steve Wonder. It was cool. Mick Jagger was leaning on my shoulder, singing 'Honky Tonk Woman' with Tina Turner."

Audio of "Uptight (Everything's Alright)", "Honky Tonk Women", "Start Me Up", and "River Deep - Mountain High" was officially released in 2011 on the compilation album Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame, Vol. 1: 1986-1991 (Live).

AROUND AND AROUND / SWEET LITTLE SIXTEEN / STAND BY ME / WHAT'D I SAY / GLORY DAYS / HAVING A PARTY / TWIST AND SHOUT

Springsteen’s fortieth birthday and a quite significant bash in historic terms. Present and backing Bruce at the party was the entire E Street Band and Steve Van Zandt. On this night the E Street Band members were completely unaware that in less than four weeks (October 18th 1989) Bruce would phone them individually to inform them he was putting the E Street Band into semi-retirement, effective immediately. This would turn out to be the last Springsteen and the E Street Band performance together for over five years (until January 1995).

1989-09-29 - MATT'S SALOON, PRESCOTT, AZ

SWEET LITTLE SIXTEEN / DON'T BE CRUEL / (GET YOUR KICKS ON) ROUTE 66 / I'M ON FIRE

With the Mile High Band, house band of the country-western bar. A newspaper article comments that Bruce arrived at the bar on his motorcycle before jumping on stage. He played for an hour - the band asked him to play "Pink Cadillac", but Bruce couldn't remember the words. Springsteen apparently told Mile High Band's rhythm guitarist Denny Orr that he was on vacation and on his way to the Grand Canyon. Barmaid Brenda "Bubbles" Pechanec must have made an impression - a week or so later Bruce sent her a cheque for $100,000 (some sources say $160,000) after hearing she was having some trouble with medical bills. Pechanec had just returned to work after undergoing cancer surgery.

THE RIVER / EVERY BREATH YOU TAKE / BIG YELLOW TAXI

Setlist details are incomplete. Bruce's only performance of Joni Mitchell's "Big Yellow Taxi" and first ever performance in the U.S. of "Every Breath You Take". A private dinner-concert held on the beautiful estate of movie producer and investor Ted Field. This was a fundraiser for the Rainforest Foundation’s fight to preserve the Amazon ecosystem, billed as “An Evening In Brazil”. About 800 guests attended (the cream of Hollywood’s music/movie “A” list), each donating/paying $5,000 a head for the privilege. The event raised about one million dollars. It was Sting who organized getting Springsteen and the others to participate in the all-star group. Bruce Hornsby, a member of the “Allstars” lineup, has jokingly commented: “It was quite a band. It was a hilarious night – actually it was basically a bunch of (band) leaders playing sidemen and butchering each others tunes. We rehearsed for two days though – we really tried to get it right.”

1990-11-16 - SHRINE AUDITORIUM, LOS ANGELES, CA

Soundcheck: DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN (multiple takes) / REASON TO BELIEVE (multiple takes)

BRILLIANT DISGUISE / DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN / MANSION ON THE HILL / REASON TO BELIEVE / RED HEADED WOMAN / 57 CHANNELS (AND NOTHIN' ON) / MY FATHER'S HOUSE / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT / ATLANTIC CITY / WILD BILLY'S CIRCUS STORY / NEBRASKA / WHEN THE LIGHTS GO OUT / THUNDER ROAD / MY HOMETOWN / REAL WORLD / HIGHWAY 61 REVISITED (with Jackson Browne and Bonnie Raitt) / ACROSS THE BORDERLINE (with Jackson Browne and Bonnie Raitt)

First of two acoustic concerts to benefit the Christic Institute. The Institute was a public interest law firm, founded in 1980. A stunning performance by Springsteen, including world premieres of "Red Headed Woman", "57 Channels (And Nothin' On)", "When The Lights Go Out" (all on the guitar) and "Real World" on the piano. Furthermore we get first time acoustic guitar versions of "Brilliant Disguise", "Darkness On The Edge Of Town", "Mansion On The Hill", "Reason To Believe", "My Father’s House", "Atlantic City", "Wild Billy’s Circus Story" (no tuba from Gary this time), and "Nebraska" (of course to follow "Wild Billy's Circus Story" – "Nebraska’s our next stop"). "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out" is performed with Bruce alone on the piano for the first time. "Thunder Road" returns to the version last seen on the first leg of the Born To Run tour (with Bruce, not Roy Bittan on the piano). "My Hometown" gets its second acoustic hearing, this time on the piano, and not on the guitar as in 1988 on the S.O.S. Racism show. Highlight is the magnificent solo piano "Real World" - an inspired performance and one of Bruce's greatest. For encores Bonnie Raitt and Jackson Browne joins in on "Highway 61 Revisited" (Bruce on harmonica, Jackson on acoustic guitar, and Bonnie on tambourine) and "Across The Borderline" (previously performed on the Tunnel Of Love Tour) – this time with Jackson on the piano and Bonnie on the slide guitar – beautiful as always.

Official concert recording available for purchase in multiple formats, including CD and high definition audio, from Springsteen's official live download site at live.brucespringsteen.net. Audience tape and camcorder video. Five recording sources circulate - the first was originally released on the triple CD set 'Springsteen, Raitt & Browne' (Templar Records) from the RT master tapes, many of the spoken parts on this source are edited. A second source is available from the master tapes recorded by Mark Persic - 'The Christic Nights - Persic Recordings' remastered by Ev2. A third source is available from the slipkid68 master tapes via JEMS. In July 2015, a previously unknown fourth source transferred from a first generation copy, recorded by legendary taper Mike Millard, was released via JEMS. The sound quality of this recording is outstanding. A fifth source, slightly distant and similar in sound to the slipkid68 version, is in limited circulation. Also available on 'Acoustic Concert' (Sounds Alive), 'American Dream' (Red Phantom), 'Acoustic Tales' (The Swingin' Pig), 'Acoustic Jewels Ultra Rare Tracks Vol.2' (Fake-The Swingin' Pig), 'Los Angeles '90' (Real Live)-edited to include only songs, 'Thunder Road' (Men At Work) and 'Unplugged' (Live Line), it's not certain which sources these releases use. Audience shot video is available on DVD 'A Little More Of The Real World' (RCR).

Second Christic Institute benefit concert. World premieres of "The Wish" and "Soul Driver" – both on the guitar. "Tougher Than The Rest" gets its first acoustic try-out on the piano and "State Trooper" is played on the guitar. The rest of the show is quite similar to previous night's show. Final solo piano "Real World" until the 2005 Devils & Dust tour.

Official concert recording available for purchase in multiple formats, including CD and high definition audio, from Springsteen's official live download site at live.brucespringsteen.net.

Audience tapes of both Christic shows are available from the master tapes recorded by Mark Persic - 'The Christic Nights - Persic Recordings' remastered by Ev2. A second audience tape was released on 'Greeting From Los Angeles' and 'More Greetings From Los Angeles' (Great Dane), which was a bonus disc with the Italian Fanzine 'Follow That Dream'. This source is taken from JEMS (MS) recording, this version was also released on the LP "Back In LA" (Soul Driver Records).There is a third source in limited circulation from slipkid68. A fourth source was released on the CD "The Lost Acoustic Show (Live Storm). A fifth source has recently surfaced from a first generation tape recorded by legendary taper Mike Millard but is not in general circulation at this time. A sixth incomplete source is in limited circulation and is missing six songs. Some 60 minutes of rough audience shot video circulates and is available on DVD.

AIN'T THAT A SHAME / SAVE THE LAST DANCE FOR ME / BETTY JEAN

With The Iguanas. Bruce (and Patti) drop in to the New Orleans bar while in town filming the "Human Touch" music video. Iguana's saxophonist Derek Huston tells that Springsteen asked Huston not to introduce him by name. So Bruce instead entered the stage to "Louie". They sing Fats Domino's "Ain't That A Shame", The Drifters' "Save The Last Dance For Me" and Chuck Berry's "Betty Jean".


1992-03-00 - ROY BITTAN’S RECORDING STUDIO, HOLLYWOOD, CA

No set details known. Tryouts for Springsteen new band, held on numerous days in March (exact dates are unknown) at an unidentified Hollywood recording studio partially owned (according to comments by Shane Fontayne) by Roy Bittan. Roy did not try out - he was a definite in the new band and actually participated with Bruce in the tryout sessions of the other would-be members. Shane Fontayne, who had come highly recommended, turned out to be the only guitarist that was given a tryout. Several bass players were given tryouts. Drummer Zack Alford has mentioned in interview that he flew out to California five times during March and early April for tryouts before he was finally told he had the job.


1992-03-00 - HOLLYWOOD CENTER STUDIOS SOUNDSTAGE, HOLLYWOOD, CA

BETTER DAYS

Filming of the "Better Days" music video, held in early March on a Hollywood soundstage and directed by Meiert Avis. The video uses live vocals, and is shot with a band and backing singers, including Patti Scialfa.

The live audience debut (albeit to a private gathering of 250 Sony executives) of the core lineup of Bruce’s new 1992-1993 tour band – Shane Fontayne (guitar), Tommy Sims (bass), Roy Bittan (keyboards), Zack Alford (drums) - along with the just-hired Bobby King (who only came out for support vocals on “Human Touch”). Springsteen opened the 90-minute show by remarking that the new lineup had only been together for two weeks and the performance was indeed ragged in places. “My Beautiful Reward” was the lone song performed acoustically. Patti Scialfa and Steve Van Zandt were in attendance, but did not perform. Springsteen returns to the famous Bottom Line - he was last there in 1976.

No circulating audio. Some pro-shot video circulates.

Broadcast: LUCKY TOWN / 57 CHANNELS (AND NOTHIN' ON) / LIVING PROOF

Bruce and the band appear on "Saturday Night Live". “57 Channels (And Nothin' On)” is short and as close to the studio version as we’ll ever get – before the remix versions’ inspiration are included in the live versions. Bruce also appeared in two short, humorous promos for the programme (one featuring him and Tom Hanks only, and the second featuring Hanks alongside “Wayne & Garth” a.k.a. Mike Myers & Dana Carvey doing their “we’re-not-worthy” routine) that are circulating among collectors as well.

TV Broadcast on NBC. Soundboard and video exists of both the rehearsals and the show. Show songs are available on CDs 'Saturday Night Live' and 'Gospel's Rain'.

THE LONG GOODBYE / BRILLIANT DISGUISE / GLORIA’S EYES

Partial setlist is known. Band rehearsals with the core lineup of Springsteen, Roy Bittan, Shane Fontayne, Tommy Sims, and Zachary Alford. This day’s rehearsals were fairly brief and featured instrumental only renditions of the songs due to Springsteen’s voice being slightly hoarse from the previous day’s rehearsal. Immediately following the rehearsal Bruce gives a backstage interview to David Hepworth of “Q” Magazine (which appeared in its August 1992 issue).


1992-05-23 - HOLLYWOOD CENTER STUDIOS SOUNDSTAGE, HOLLYWOOD, CA

First rehearsal together of the entire eleven-person lineup of the 1992-93 touring band – Springsteen-Bittan-Fontayne-Sims-Alford, plus Bobby King and Crystal Taliefero and the four female backing singers, Ciambotti-Dennis-Kennedy-Rogers. Around sixteen minutes of professionally shot video circulates, featuring extensive workouts of "Real World" and a single performance of "Better Days" on a full stage setup with the full band, dating the video to around this date. In reality, there were likely more rehearsals in the following days so it is almost impossible to pin down the exact day the video was shot.

Rehearsal concert. "Born In The U.S.A." through "Hungry Heart" are broadcast on U.S. Radio. “Born In The U.S.A.” includes the “The Star-Spangled Banner” intro - a regular for this tour. “57 Channels (And Nothin' On)” is the “remix-version”. “My Hometown” does not include the keyboard intro played during the Human Rights Now Tour. Steve Van Zandt guests on "57 Channels (And Nothin' On)", “Glory Days”, and "Bobby Jean", while “Hungry Heart” gets an unplugged airing, with Bruce on acoustic guitar and harmonica and a full vocal arrangement - very nice indeed. Patti Scialfa guests on "Human Touch".

1992-07-02 - PLAZA MONUMENTAL, BARCELONA, SPAIN

Concert cancelled due to transport strikes in France and rescheduled to July 4. Truck drivers blocked the roads which meant that trucks carrying equipment could not travel to Barcelona from the previous concert in Paris. A local company called Triple Onda were hired to set up a stage along with sound and light systems at the Plaza Monumental. George Travis and people from the local promoter and production company visited the Triple Onda headquarters on July 2 to check the PA systems. They liked what the company had so they decided to use their stage, light and sound systems for the shows in Barcelona. While most of the trucks remained stuck in France, the truck carrying instruments was fortunately able to travel to Barcelona.

Bruce performs for MTV's Unplugged concert series, but after an acoustic "Red Headed Woman" the show is most decidedly plugged in. Final performance of "Book Of Dreams" until 2005. Patti Scialfa joins for "Human Touch". "Leap Of Faith" requires a restart and "Darkness On The Edge Of Town" is played twice. Uniquely, every song from Lucky Town is performed.

Soundboard and professionally shot video of both soundcheck and concert. Released on CDs '57 Channels And Bruce Plugged In' (The Beat Goes On), 'Original Lives' (Musictape), 'I Wish I'll Hear The Thunder' (All About Fame) and 'Plugged' (RP). Soundcheck released on CD 'Plugged: The Rehearsals' (Kiss The Stone). A high quality digital soundboard recording from the production truck emerged in February 2015. This was recorded live, with no edits or post-production and includes "Leap Of Faith" and the false start, for the first time. However, the second take of "Darkness On The Edge Of Town" and "Glory Days" are missing. Officially released – in incomplete form and featuring a totally mixed-up song sequence – in April 1993 on the In Concert/MTV xxPlugged double vinyl/CD album, VHS, US-only laserdisc (with “Roll Of The Dice” as a bonus track) and, most recently on DVD, which also includes “Roll Of The Dice” as its only “extra”. Two additional audio recordings from this show (“Growin’ Up” and “The Big Muddy”) later turned up on the Streets Of Philadelphia CD EP. Video of the complete and unedited MTV performance (apart from "Leap Of Faith") is circulating on a high-quality, fan-made DVD titled 'Plugged And Uncut'. Audio taken from this DVD release is available on CD, with the same title (KBM Keefer). Video footage of "Leap Of Faith" is also available on DVD, but in lower quality from a higher generation tape source.

"Does This Bus Stop At 82nd Street?" is first, last played December 31, 1975 at the Tower Theater in Upper Darby, PA. "I Ain't Got No Home” follows, played only once before, during the Human Rights tour. World live premiere of Born In The USA outtake "This Hard Land". It will become a regular on the tour after this show, all versions acoustic. “Local Hero” is an extra long version with Bruce slowing the song down twice. First known live performance of “Viva Las Vegas”, it'll be played just twice in the tour. Last known performance of “All The Way Home” until 2005. Last “Tougher Than The Rest” until 1996 (solo) and 1999 (with the band). Live premiere of “When You're Alone”, performed acoustically. It'll return for a handful of performances in the latter stages of the 1996 leg of The Ghost Of Tom Joad Tour. “Point Blank” is the first of two acoustic versions for the tour, played on the guitar by Bruce alone. Only ever appearance of “Achy Breaky Heart”, apparently played in a spur of the moment. First performance of “Blinded By The Light” for some seventeen years, last played in April 1976. “The Promised Land” (last heard at the final Human Rights Now! concert in Buenos Aires) is played on the guitar by Bruce alone. Max Weinberg guests on "Glory Days". Only the second ever “Janey, Don’t You Lose Heart” closes the set, played by Springsteen alone. Next performance of the Born In The USA outtake will be August 7, 1999 in New Jersey during the Reunion Tour.

Kristen Ann Carr Fund Benefit Concert. The fund is dedicated to fighting Sarcoma. Joe Ely and Terence Trent D'Arby guest. Joe Ely plays guitar and sings on "Lonesome Valley" and "Settle For Love". Terence Trent D'Arby plays guitar and sings on on "Many Rivers To Cross", "I Have Faith In These Desolate Times", "Jole Blon", and "Jumpin' Jack Flash". Patti Scialfa plays guitar and sings on "Brilliant Disguise" and "Human Touch". Soozie Tyrell plays violin on "If I Should Fall Behind", the third arrangement for the tour. First ever performance in the U.S. of "Many Rivers To Cross". “Follow That Dream” is closer to the version played on the River Tour, with Roy’s keyboard providing the backing together with the lovely back-up vocals. Sadly, this show is perhaps best known for the Terence Trent D'Arby "event". After D'Arby was booed Bruce admonished the crowd: "Terence Trent D´Arby... need I remind some of you rude motherfuckers that everybody onstage is my guest?".

CHAIN SMOKIN’ / NEVER BE ENOUGH TIME

In late October and early November Springsteen (with Toby Scott recording and Bob Clearmountain mixing) produces a recording session for Joe Grushecky. In addition to Springsteen on guitar, Grushecky’s backing band for this session consisted of musicians organized by Springsteen that he is believed to have utilized for some of his own scattered studio sessions during the period - Zack Alford (drums), Jerome Smith (bass) and Leon Pendarvis (keyboards). Although originally planned as a “one-off”, this session with Grushecky turned out to be the start of a major side project undertaking for Springsteen (note: see Brucebase listings under February 1994, August 1994, October 1994 and April 1995 for the other segments of this project).

Both above-noted recordings were first released on Grushecky’s album American Babylon in October 1995.

1993-12-06 - VARIOUS LOCATIONS, PHILADELPHIA, PA

STREETS OF PHILADELPHIA

Video shoot for "Streets Of Philadelphia". Directed by Jonathan Demme, the shoot is understood to have taken place over several days at various locations in the city. For example, the playground with the chain-link fence and "Don't Believe The Pipe" mural is on South 4th Street in south Philadelphia. Springsteen later donated $45,000 to spruce up the playground. The vocal track for the video was recorded "live" by Springsteen, utilising hidden microphones. The same technique was used for the "Brilliant Disguise" music video in 1987, "Better Days" in 1992 and once again in 2002 for "Lonesome Day".

1994-01-20 - WALDORF-ASTORIA HOTEL, NEW YORK CITY, NY

COME TOGETHER

With Axl Rose. Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony. This duet was originally scheduled / planned for Rod Stewart and Elton John. Rod Stewart didn't make the event because of the earthquake in Los Angeles shortly before the event. As Bob Weir / John Popper and others performed on stage the production personnel approached Bruce with the lyrics to "Come Together". Bruce politely refused, repeatedly. The producers then approached Axl Rose who was at the next table over. Axl agreed and then pulled up a chair next to Bruce. After a minute or two of conversation, Axl put the lyrics on the table and Bruce and Axl hovered over the paper for a few minutes. As Bob Weir, John Popper et al. left the stage, Bruce and Axl simply got up, walked onto the stage and rocked. No rehearsal. No practice. Amazing to witness. 1994's inductees include The Animals, The Band, Elton John and Bob Marley.

Audio officially released in 2011 on the compilation album Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame, Vol. 2: 1992-1994 (Live).

STREETS OF PHILADELPHIA

Springsteen, along with a band consisting of Roy Bittan and three other, as-yet unidentified, musicians shoot a video of “Street Of Philadelphia” with the stage set being outfitted with city street props. This obscure video clip, which appears to have been filmed in black & white except for brief color that appears near the end, premiered on the UK’s ‘Top Of The Pops’ TV show in spring 1994 and was announced as being “Live by satellite from New York”, although the “live” claim seems unlikely.

HOMESTEAD

Springsteen (with Toby Scott recording and Bob Clearmountain mixing) produces a recording session for Joe Grushecky, on a song they had co-written together during the previous few months.

Please see Brucebase listings under November 1993, August 1994, October 1994 and April 1995 for the other segments of this project.

COMIN’ DOWN MARIA / NO STRINGS ATTACHED / TALK SHOW

Springsteen (with Toby Scott recording and mixing) produces a further recording session for Joe Grushecky (with the Houserockers as the studio backing band). Unlike the previous three Springsteen-Grushecky recording sessions for this album project (November 1993, February 1994 and August 1994 – see Brucebase listings), Springsteen does not play on these three session recordings, although Patti Scialfa provides backing vocals on the first track listed above.

All three of these recordings were first released on Joe’s album American Babylon in October 1995. Although the album was essentially completed at this stage (it was filed with the U.S. Copyright Office on December 13, 1994), Grushecky had trouble finding an interested record company. As Grushecky has commented in interview: “We got turned down by everybody, I mean everybody. That’s another reason why it took so long (for release); I didn’t have any funding….. right around the turn of the year (December 1994-January 1995). Pinnacle UK became involved and we knew we had a home for the project.”

AMERICAN MUSIC / HIGH SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL

Springsteen guests with The Blasters. Bruce plays guitar, but no vocals. "American Music" is the opening track from The Blasters' 1980 album with the same title. Phil Alvin remembers: "We played this gig at the House of Blues and Bruce Springsteen was there. I didn't know much about how he could play guitar, but Man! He knew all the Blaster tunes! Springsteen was playin' great! The show was already sold out when Springsteen got there, the management was excited, and all the buzz was going on. Later, the House of Blues guys called and said they wanted us back by popular demand. So we got the idea to make a live record and call it The Blasters Live at the House of Blues."

1995-04-07 - SONY MUSIC STUDIOS, NEW YORK CITY, NY

Bruce is interviewed by renowned Australian music journalist Ian "Molly" Meldrum as part of the promotional push for the Greatest Hits album. It is extraordinary on a number of levels, making it undoubtedly one of the most fascinating interviews of Bruce's career ever committed to film. Usually, Bruce and his management keep tight control of his contact with the media. Questions must be submitted beforehand and follow-ups are generally not allowed. However, Molly Meldrum had other ideas. He was granted just 15 minutes, but was determined to get a much longer interview that he could use for a worldwide syndicated TV special. He was impeccably polite, but refused to relent on his persistent line of questioning. The interview starts in conventional fashion, but Meldrum quickly throws in a question that isn't on the approved list. Bruce seems intrigued, but his minders (who are just off-camera) are less amused. The tension grows and Bruce starts to cast glances to someone else in the room. The questions are unique and insightful, drawing on the in-depth knowledge of someone who is obviously a dedicated fan. Examples include questions on unreleased songs recorded in 1986 and the verse about Bruce's father that was deleted from "Glory Days". Bruce seems to be caught off-guard at times, but he remains in good spirits throughout. It was admirable that Bruce let the interview continue, despite the fact that he was clearly being signaled to end it. This is probably because Meldrum was smart enough to avoid questions of a personal nature and the issue of bootlegs is cleverly circumvented when it comes up. After a gruelling 90 minutes, the interview is finally called to a halt. Springsteen's management (who are never seen on camera) were apparently furious at what unfolded and they refused to allow Meldrum to use more than the originally allocated 15 minutes, so the TV Special never came to fruition. A complete transcript of the interview is available, and can be viewed by clicking the date/location link above.

The complete interview eventually leaked to collectors, and circulates on DVD.

ALL JUST TO GET TO YOU / I’M A THOUSAND MILES FROM HOME

Springsteen travels to Joe Ely’s home studio and contributes vocals and synthesizer on two tracks, both of which were first issued on Ely’s album Letter To Laredo on August 29, 1995.

A promotional-only video of “All Just To Get To You (produced by Adrian Pasdar) features Springsteen, as does an obscure, twenty-minute promotional mini-documentary about Ely that was broadcast in Europe (but not shown in the U.S.A.) in late 1995.

EVERYTHING I DO (LEADS ME BACK TO YOU)

Bruce records vocal overdubs for the above-mentioned Elliott Murphy song, which was first released on Murphy’s Selling The Gold album in December 1995. The recording sessions for the rest of this Murphy album took place at IPC Studios in Belgium. However Springsteen did not attend those sessions, he recorded his parts at his home studio and then sent them to Murphy.

With Wolfgang Niedecken And His Leopardefellband. One of the numerous “Hungry Heart” takes recorded during this performance was officially released on the Hungry Heart CD EP as “Hungry Heart [Berlin 95]” later the same year, although this just featured Bruce’s live vocals from the Eckstein show laid over the original 1980 E Street Band instrumental tracks! First ever Springsteen performance of "Knockin' On Heaven's Door" and first performances in Europe of "Down The Road Apiece", "Highway 61 Revisited", and "Honky Tonk Women", and first ever Springsteen performance in Germany of "Jumpin' Jack Flash".

Soundboard tape (main set) and professionally shot video (virtually the entire show). Much of this rather bizarre mini-concert (unedited raw footage with just one version of “Hungry Heart” included, but containing all the other songs in complete form) is now circulating on a fan-made DVD in excellent quality - 'Cafe Eckstein Vol 2' (Digitox). A factory-pressed silver CD called 'Secret Berlin Night' (presumably taken from the DVD audio source) has also been released on the “Pablo” label. Bruce also shot a video for "Hungry Heart" in Berlin, which is included on the The Complete Video Anthology 1978-2000.

Premiere of Woody Guthrie's "Blowin' Down This Road", performed with Joe Ely. First time that a show on this tour has not finished with "My Best Was Never Good Enough". Bruce and Ely hooked up with Willie Nelson after his show in Austin. Bruce and Joe went to see Willie Nelson after his show at the Hang-Em-High Saloon on 6th Street. All three then played music in Willie's bus outside Hang-Em-High until 4am. That could be why Bruce sounded tired the next night. Willie and Bruce apparently got along famously. In fact, Willie asked Bruce to stay in Austin for another night so they could play a gig together. Bruce said he had a commitment in Dallas that night.

Final show of the European leg of the Solo Acoustic Tour. During the soundcheck Bruce tried out a verse in Spanish for “Across The Border” - but it didn't work out, so it was not done in the show. Some pro-shot footage of three songs circulates, along with a brief interview. After the show Bruce, crew & friends went to ‘Samarkanda’ nightclub for a Sony PR party. Surprisingly, while backstage, Bruce had told everyone (working people included), that they were invited to the party. Once there, Bruce received an IFPI Platinum Certification Award for retail sales of 1 million copies of the The Ghost Of Tom Joad album across Europe. During his acceptance speech Springsteen spoke about his debut album and remembering seeing the famous red Columbia label on it, "like the Bob Dylan albums," and then he knew "I was on the right label." Attendees included top Sony Music executive Don Lenner, plus Jon Landau, Barbara Carr and Dave Marsh. Following his speech, Springsteen was besieged by many from Sony and after five minutes Bruce slowly walked through the crowd and went to the corner where our little party was (basically people who worked at the show, not fans nor industry-type people). He thanked the people in the group and had a champagne toast with us! It was great to see him up close, talking directly and looking into your eyes. He stayed all night dancing with the girls in our group. At around 5.00am, Bruce and his crew left straight to the Madrid airport.

Audience tape. Released on CDR 'Bruce In The Temple Of Love', 'La Noche De La Musica Tranquila' (missing "Bobby Jean"), and 'Dry Lightning On The Horizon Line'.

SHAKE, RATTLE AND ROLL / MUSTANG SALLY

Springsteen drops by to catch the final set of the evening by The Fanatics, the restaurant's resident house band, led by guitarist Marc Moriva. Bruce hopped onstage and sang two songs, to the astonishment of the small audience. The Fanatics had been hired to play at Toby Scott’s wedding reception the following day. It appears Bruce, in anticipation of performing the next day, wanted to meet the band and get in a bit of practice.

During the show someone yells out for "Jungleland", and Bruce just laughs and said "What are you crazy?" Then before the first encore, Bruce walks out says, "Now for Jungleland!", pauses, before saying something to the effect of "Get the fuck out of here!"

A couple of debuts and several songs finding their way back into the set of many months. "Tom Joad" (a.k.a. The Ballad Of Tom Joad) is the Woody Guthrie song and apparently performed in preparation for the Woody Guthrie tribute show this weekend. A great performance. After "It's The Little Things That Count", Bruce said, "Speaking of tongues, here's a song about cunnilingus" and launched into an excellent "Red Headed Woman". After that, he started strumming and said, "this is a song I wrote after the Nebraska album, I think it was on the flip-side of something", and then played a wonderful "Shut Out The Light". "Murder Incorporated" returns to the set after a short break.

At the start of the show Bruce mentions that he wrecked the balcony when he was a young man - he was referring to the November 6, 1975 show, when he delivered a blistering performance during the Born To Run Tour that worked the crowd into a frenzy, so much so that the balcony was visibly swaying. See the November 6, 1975 entry for a little more detail. Nils Lofgren joins Bruce for "No Surrender".

OH, WHAT A BEAUTIFUL MORNIN' / THE GHOST OF TOM JOAD

Tribute and stage dedication to stage director Elaine Steinbeck (widow of Grapes of Wrath author John Steinbeck). Elaine was present for the show (note: she passed away in 2003).

1998-10-27 - THE SAINT, ASBURY PARK, NJ

BORN IN THE U.S.A. / BORN IN THE U.S.A. / "BBC BLUES"

Video shoot for the BBC A Secret History documentary. Springsteen is interviewed and performs the solo acoustic "Born In The U.S.A." twice. "BBC Blues" isn't really a song, just Bruce improvising lyrics about being interviewed over a standard Blues progression. Mark Hagen (Producer of the documentary) coined the title "BBC Blues".

The documentary is broadcast on BBC 2 on December 5, 1998, aimed at promoting the Tracks box set. The documentary included plenty of previously unseen video footage, including "Janey Don't You Lose Heart" from Los Angeles on September 27, 1985, "Twist And Shout" from Basel, July 14, 1988 and film from November 18, 1975 at Hammersmith Odeon.

1999-02-12 - THRILL HILL EAST, RUMSON, NJ

GIVE MY LOVE TO ROSE

Springsteen solo performance of a Johnny Cash song that was simultaneously audio-video recorded. Springsteen produced the audio and Toby Scott recorded it – but the identity of film director is a mystery. First broadcast commercially on April 18, 1999 as part of the Johnny Cash Tribute special on the U.S.A.’s TNT network.

The audio was officially released in September 2002 on the Cash Kindred Spirits tribute album. The video has yet to be officially issued, although it circulates via copies of the original TV broadcast.

1999-03-00 - CONVENTION HALL, ASBURY PARK, NJ

LAND OF HOPE AND DREAMS / FURTHER ON (UP THE ROAD) / WAITIN' ON A SUNNY DAY / RESTLESS NIGHTS / THE PRICE YOU PAY / + many others

Springsteen & The E Street Band rehearsals for the upcoming "Reunion" tour. Max Weinberg stated in a late February 1999 interview that rehearsals had not yet started, so it appears that all rehearsals took place during the month of March. However security was tight so exact dates and setlists are unclear. However, the setlists below are accurate. In reviewing original media/fan reports of these rehearsals there are five songs that warrant special mention. Three then-new and previously undocumented Springsteen compositions were rehearsed – “Land Of Hope And Dreams” (it premiered live early in the tour), “Further On (Up The Road)” (it premiered live near the end of the tour) and “Waitin' On A Sunny Day” (sound-checked mid tour but not played in concert). “American Skin (41 Shots)” was not rehearsed in March, as Bruce didn’t write the song until mid-tour. “Restless Nights” is the only song from the Tracks box that is known to have been rehearsed that was not later played at least once on the Reunion tour - it would not be performed in concert until the Working On A Dream tour in 2009. “The Price You Pay” (from the River album) was the notable regular album catalog song that was rehearsed but then not subsequently performed on the 1999-2000 tour.

Both "Waitin' On A Sunny Day" and "Further On (Up The Road)" would eventually be officially released on The Rising in 2002.

The former was run-through at least five times. There will be no more rehearsal sessions before the Hall Of Fame show with a heavy metal show taking over the Convention Hall between March 12 and March 15.

"The River" is a new arrangement with a long introductory sax solo, and a slower, more acoustic style. "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out" features the band introductions, as it will throughout the tour. "Light Of Day" includes "I've Been Everywhere", as it will throughout the tour. "Factory" is played for the first time since 1984. E Street premiere for "If I Should Fall Behind".

By June 24, the "Reunion" tour of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band was winding up the European leg of the tour and they were playing hot. One of the highlights from the European tour was the many Tracks songs that were played on a regular basis but didn't get many airings once the tour returned to North America, especially "I Wanna Be With You" and "Loose Ends," both of which were played on June 24 to a very enthusiastic crowd. Many fan favorite songs from the 70s and 80s returned to the set on the 1999-2000 tour, and several of those are represented here, including "Jungleland", "Two Hearts", "Born to Run", and "Thunder Road". But the high point for many long-time fans were the last two songs of the night, "If I Should Fall Behind", which featured Bruce, Steve Van Zandt, Patti Scialfa, Nils Lofgren, and Clarence Clemons sharing vocals, and "Land of Hope and Dreams", a mid-tempo rocker with almost spiritual lyrics. “Factory” is performed as a country-duet with Patti. Other highlights from the tour included the segment from "Youngstown", done in a full-band arrangement."Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out" includes "It's All Right", "Move On Up", "Lookin' For A Love", a near-complete rendition of "Fire", and "Rumble Doll", plus Steve playing a snippet of "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction" for his solo. "Light Of Day" includes "I Hear A Train" and "I've Been Everywhere". Max Weinberg messes up the beat during “Stand On It”. First ever performances in Sweden of "I Wanna Be With You" and "Loose Ends".

Audience tape available on CD 'Stockholm Fire' (Piggham) and on CD 'Olympic Stadium Second Night' (Crystal Cat). The latter is of particularly high quality.

End of the European leg of the "Reunion" tour

1999-07-02 - DISNEY SOUNDSTAGE STUDIOS, NEW YORK CITY, NY

In a Manhattan studio Springsteen makes his first-ever appearance in a feature film (i.e., excluding documentaries and music films/videos), playing himself during a 2-minute dream sequence for the movie High Fidelity. It was the final scene shot for the film. John Cusack, the movie’s co-producer, screenwriter and lead actor, had first contacted Springsteen in 1998 asking him to participate - surprisingly Bruce said “yes” (Bob Dylan, Cusack’s first choice for this role, had declined). In the film Bruce performs a blues riff (copyrighted as "Blues Guitar Riff (High Fidelity)" at the US Copyright Office in 1999) on guitar while talking to the film’s dreaming lead character (Cusack), who ends the conversation with Bruce by saying “Good luck, goodbye” (a spoof of the final line in Springsteen’s song “Bobby Jean”).

The film was released on March 31, 2000.

Concert rescheduled from September 16. Tour premieres of “Growin’ Up”, “Does This Bus Stop At 82nd Street?” and “The Fever”, last played with the band at the final Darkness tour show. Last known performance of "Blinded By The Light" was in April 1976. “No Surrender” is the full band version. “Badlands” has the ending played twice. “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out” includes "It's All Right", two lines of Stevie Wonder's “Happy Birthday”, "Take Me To The River", and "Red Headed Woman", while “Light Of Day” includes “You Can’t Sit Down” and "I've Been Everywhere". Known as "The Birthday Show" as it took place one day after Bruce's 50th birthday, this show was a high point for many, many fans. While the other five shows in Philadelphia on this stand took place at the First Union Center, this show moved 150 yards to the old Spectrum building (now the First Union Spectrum), a venue steeped in Springsteen history (first arena show on October 25, 1976; great shows in 1978, 1981, and 1984). In another twist, this show was supposed to have taken place on September 16, but had to be postponed due to heavy rains caused by a hurricane. So the last two shows of the stand occurred immediately after Bruce Springsteen's fiftieth birthday, and those two shows turned out to be among the best shows of the 1999-2000 tour. Because of the atmosphere and venue, however, this night gets the nod over the September 25 show. Bruce took to the stage with a boom box and played a tape of a song, called "Nineteen Hundred and Ninety-Nine" that was sung by a female fan who had mailed the tape to Bruce's mother. In fact, the song was sung by Carol Bradley, who lived next door to his mother. The band then launched into the tour premiere of "Growin' Up," followed by "No Surrender." Other tour debuts on this night included "Does This Bus Stop At 82nd Street?", "Blinded by the Light," and "The Fever". This was also the first scheduled performance of "The Fever" since the Darkness Tour; while it was played at the January 31, 1998, Pat King Benefit concert, that was totally spontaneous, but it was rehearsed and on the set list for this show.

Audience tape and partial DVD. Audience tape available as 'The Big 50 (I'd Rather Be In Philly!)' (Ev2). This show hasn't been released by a major bootleg label, but a CDR of this show is widely available, and while it's not an amazing recording, the energy and vibe come through nonetheless. Check out "Prove It All Night" for a demonstration.

1999-10-17 - STAPLES CENTER, LOS ANGELES, CA

Soundcheck: PINK CADILLAC (intro) / JANEY DON'T YOU LOSE HEART / LOOSE ENDS / PROVE IT ALL NIGHT / MY LOVE WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN (intro x3) / THE GHOST OF TOM JOAD / BORN IN THE U.S.A. (partial)

The "Pink Cadillac" intro was the instrumental, mostly Nils Lofgren on guitar and Max Weinberg on drums, that was played during the '85 stadium tour. Bruce appeared for "Prove It" and sang the hell out of it. The intro to "My Love Will Not Let You Down" was worked on a lot, a real soulful treatment that really added to the show. "The Ghost of Tom Joad" was the full band and excellent. "Born In The U.S.A." was the standard acoustic version.

MY LOVE WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN / PROVE IT ALL NIGHT / TWO HEARTS / DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN / THE PROMISED LAND / MANSION ON THE HILL / THE RIVER / YOUNGSTOWN / MURDER INCORPORATED / BADLANDS / OUT IN THE STREET / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT / YOU CAN LOOK (BUT YOU BETTER NOT TOUCH) / WORKING ON THE HIGHWAY / THE GHOST OF TOM JOAD / BORN IN THE U.S.A. / BACKSTREETS / LIGHT OF DAY - CALIFORNIA SUN / RAMROD / BOBBY JEAN / BORN TO RUN / THUNDER ROAD / IF I SHOULD FALL BEHIND / LAND OF HOPE AND DREAMS

First night of four in Los Angeles, with Bruce and the band the first performers at the brand-new Staples Center. 24-song set opens with "My Love Will Not Let You Down" after the "Meeting In The Town Tonight" introduction, and also includes "You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)". "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out" includes "It's All Right, "Take Me To The River", and "Red Headed Woman". "Born In The U.S.A." is the acoustic version. "Light Of Day" includes a snippet of "California Sun", with a very funny reference to plastic surgery, and "I've Been Everywhere", plus Steve playing a snippet of "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction" in the midsection. From a fan present, "I was behind the stage and saw Danny's set list and they dropped out "Brilliant Disguise" after "Working On The Highway" and before "The Ghost Of Tom Joad". It was indented on the list so maybe it was there in case they had enough time.

Show opens with the "Meeting In The Town Tonight" introduction, and the 25-song set includes a beautiful "Racing In The Street" which unusually features Springsteen playing acoustic guitar during an outstanding instrumental coda.

End of the first leg of the "Reunion" tour

1999-12-04 - THE DIASCO RESIDENCE, COLTS NECK, NJ

RED HEADED WOMAN / LUCILLE / TREAT HER RIGHT / OH, PRETTY WOMAN / IT'S ALL OVER NOW / HAVING A PARTY

In June 1999, at a Doug Flutie Autism Foundation fundraising gala held at Jon Bon Jovi’s estate in Middletown, guests Anthony and Pam Diasco paid $60,000 during the evening’s dinner auction for right to host a very private Bon Jovi band concert at their home. The performance took place on December 4 at the Diasco’s estate in Colts Neck. Although Springsteen’s services were not part of June auction, the Diasco’s got a bonus - Bruce (as well as Patti Scialfa and Southside Johnny) attended the December 4 party and Bruce (backed by Bon Jovi) performed the above-noted songs.

No circulating audio.


1999-12-20 - McLOONE'S RUM RUNNER, SEA BRIGHT, NJ

SHAKE, RATTLE AND ROLL / MUSTANG SALLY / PROUD MARY / TRAVELIN' BAND / GREEN RIVER / ROCKIN' AROUND THE CHRISTMAS TREE (Patti Scialfa) / SHE LOVES YOU / A HARD DAY'S NIGHT / PLEASE PLEASE ME / BORN ON THE BAYOU / SANTA CLAUS IS COMIN' TO TOWN

Bruce plays his annual Christmas party at McLoone's Rum Runner in Sea Bright, NJ. Though the date is not certain it seems the party took place on December 20, and Bruce joined Bobby Bandiera's band for well over an hour, performing Beatles and Creedence Clearwater Revival songs among other classics. Patti Scialfa provides the vocals for "Rockin' Around The Christmas Tree", which was originally sung by Brenda Lee when first released in 1958.

The first six songs listed above derive from a partial audience tape, and are in performance order. The others are from attendee reports, and may not be in order.

Audience, IEM and DVD. Released on CDR 'An Other-Worldly Groove' - this is an IEM/AUD mix apart from the last track which is AUD only. Also from Ev2's 5-IEM mix, with more audience sound than other releases of this show. During "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out", you can actually hear Clarence's vocals in the background - doesn't happen too often. Bruce's and Steve's guitars are high in the mix, but then again Nils' guitar is very low for some reason. (The audience mix makes it a little more audible). ('Insure Me Now! Vol. 2', Ev2). Originally released as part of the 'Uber Series' (Volume 4) on 'What Does Rock 'N' Roll Mean To You'. Soundcheck includes Human Touch outtake "Leavin' Train". Available on DVD 'One More For Hartford', which is dubbed with the 5-IEM mix.

Postscript - it's fair to say that nobody really expected the reaction, on almost international proportions which the song "American Skin (41 Shots)" would proceed to generate with everyone from the Mayor of New York, the entire NYPD, and the press taking sides over both the song, it's content and the message it may or may not convey. Anyway - this site doesn't take sides - but it is useful to document the issue for the archives.

Now I'm out here on this road
Alone on this road tonight
[I] close my eyes and feel so many
friends around me
In the early evening light
And the miles we have come
And the battles won and lost
Are just so many roads traveled
So many rivers crossed
And I ask God for the strength
And faith in one another
'Cause it's a good night for a ride
'Cross this river to the other side
My blood brothers

Southside, Little Steven and Bobby Bandiera shows up for "This Time It's For Real", "Until The Good Is Gone" with Steve on lead and "All I Needed Was You" with Southside, Bruce and Steve sharing the lead. Nils does "Shine Silently" before Bruce drives home "Merry Christmas Baby" with a full horn backing and return to his youth with a horn-filled "So Young And In Love". "Roll Of The Dice" and "Bobby Jean" are familiar versions before a great "Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)" with Jon Landau ends the main set. "My City Of Ruins" also gets the horn-treatment including a beautiful muted trumpet solo – Great!. "I Don't Want To Go Home" includes Southside, Steve and Bruce on lead vocals, "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" also get the horn section treatment, before "Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town" rounds off the evening. All this with only two days of rehearsals – well done, lads.

The telethon features many musicians and actors in three different cities, with actors describing heroic efforts by ordinary people during the September 11th tragedies.

First night of this year's Christmas concerts. Multiple guests and a fantastic setlist. The entire E Street Band except Roy Bittan and Steve Van Zandt joins the Max Weinberg 7 as the band. “Something” and “My Sweet Lord” are played by Bruce as a tribute to George Harrison who passed away recently. “Jam Up” is Max Weinberg 7 at full tilt. “Santa Claus, Santa Claus” includes Bruce, Jimmy Vivino and Max Weinberg 7. "Thundercrack" is next up, last known to have been played in Austin, TX at the Armadillo World Headquarters in March 1974. "Seaside Bar Song" follows, previously played in June 1973, some 28 years ago. “Love (Stand Up)” and “Spanish Dancer” are Patti’s spotlight. “Welcome To The World” and "New York Skyline” are Garland Jeffreys' contributions. Then Southside gets three slots before Nils does the next two. Bruce drives it home from there with Bobby Bandiera doing a solo acoustic “Here Comes The Sun” and Southside sharing lead on “I Don’t Want To Go Home”. Otherwise quite similar to last years show.

The full E Street Band minus Roy Bittan and Steve Van Zandt, is again present. Much the same as last night, but Bruce kicks off with a great “Wild Billy’s Circus Story” (with Garry Tallent on tuba!) – and “gets the crowd to count along, 95, 96, 97…” “Talk To Me” replaces “Love On The Wrong Side Of Town” in Southside Johnny’s slot, sung together with Bruce. “The E Street Shuffle” replaces “So Young And In Love”. "Here Comes The Sun" is again Bobby Bandiera solo acoustic.

It’s time to rearrange the set list again; “Deck The Halls” with the horn section kicks it off. "Incident On 57th Street" is almost like going back to February 1975 - Suki Lahav is replaced by Soozie Tyrell. “Jingle Bell Rock” starts off acoustically country style before the whole assembly turns it into New Orleans Christmas. A new artist enters the stage replacing Garland Jeffreys; Bruce Hornsby does “Spider Fingers” introduced by “O Come, All Ye Faithful” before doing Don Henley's “The End Of The Innocence” together with Bruce. “You Sexy Thing” is introduced as “one of the great accordion songs, the song that made the accordion famous”. “This Time Baby’s Gone For Good” replaces “Talk To Me” during Southside Johnny’s slot, Nils Lofgren does an acoustic version of “The Star-Spangled Banner” before “If I Should Fall Behind”, close to the version Bruce recorded back in 1992 adding a horn part. “So Young And In Love” returns and replaces “The E Street Shuffle”. The full E Street Band, minus Roy Bittan and Steve Van Zandt, is again present, and The Alliance Singers join once again. "Here Comes The Sun" is again Bobby Bandiera solo acoustic.

Another warm up gig, this time for contest winners and guests. However, none of this footage has ever been used. "Countin' On A Miracle" gets its live premiere. "Empty Sky" is acoustic, as it will be performed throughout the tour. "Into The Fire" features Clarence Clemons on bagpipes. First public E Street Band performance of "Glory Days" since 1988. "Born In The U.S.A." is full-band. "Land Of Hope And Dreams" is performed with the "People Get Ready" interlude for the first time.

Audience tape. Full camera crew recorded the event, hence two versions of "The Rising".

BACK IN YOUR ARMS / TOUGHER THAN THE REST (with Patti Scialfa) / I WISH I WERE BLIND / GROWIN' UP / THUNDER ROAD (with Patti Scialfa)

2002-07-30 - CONVENTION HALL, ASBURY PARK, NJ

Soundcheck: DOES THIS BUS STOP AT 82ND STREET? / FOR YOU / WAITIN' ON A SUNNY DAY

Morning: THE RISING / LONESOME DAY / GLORY DAYS / INTO THE FIRE

"Does This Bus Stop At 82nd Street?" and "For You" are solo acoustic versions; "Waitin' On A Sunny Day" is a unique rendition with Bruce on guitar and Nils Lofgren, Patti Scialfa, Garry Tallent, and Clarence Clemons joining in on vocals and saxophone from Clarence. Audience recording of the soundcheck circulates amongst collectors.

A busy day for Bruce and the Band - the soundcheck was at 7:30am, followed by the live broadcast for the Today Show later in the day - and then:

Evening: THE RISING / LONESOME DAY / COVER ME / THE FUSE / DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN / EMPTY SKY / YOU'RE MISSING / WAITIN' ON A SUNNY DAY / THE PROMISED LAND / WORLDS APART / TWO HEARTS - IT TAKES TWO / MARY'S PLACE / MY HOMETOWN / PARADISE / COUNTIN' ON A MIRACLE / AMERICAN SKIN (41 SHOTS) / BORN IN THE U.S.A. / INTO THE FIRE / THUNDER ROAD / GLORY DAYS / MY CITY OF RUINS / BORN TO RUN / LAND OF HOPE AND DREAMS - PEOPLE GET READY

Public rehearsal. Killer setlist and all reports say the concert was good too. "Paradise" has its live premiere and "Cover Me" makes its first appearance since 1992. "Two Hearts" includes "It Takes Two", not as a duet with Steve but as a call-and-response bit with the audience. "American Skin (41 Shots)" played in a new arrangement. "Born In The U.S.A." is solo acoustic. "Into The Fire" was scheduled before "Born In The U.S.A.", but Clarence Clemons knocked over all the microphone stands so it moved to after "Born In The U.S.A." with no bagpipes intro. "Land Of Hope And Dreams" includes "People Get Ready" for the first time.

The morning performance was broadcast live for the Today Show. The soundcheck material was also filmed. A Audience tape exists for the evening show. The full rehearsal show has been released on CDR '30th Of July, Asbury Park' and CDs 'Rehearsal Night' (Crystal Cat) and 'Asbury Park 2002' (Asbury Records).

2002-09-20 - VARIOUS LOCATIONS, ASBURY PARK, NJ

LONESOME DAY

Video shoot for "Lonesome Day", held at locations on and around the Asbury Park boardwalk. The video is directed by Mark Pellington and features a "live" vocal, a technique previously used by Springsteen on "Brilliant Disguise", "Streets Of Philadelphia" and "Better Days". During each take, Springsteen performed the vocals live on camera, which The Rising producer Brendan O'Brien edited and mastered for the final cut of the video. "The most striking thing about making this video was the fact that Bruce sang every take live, nailing the vocal take after take, each time," said Pellington. "The final take came 16 hours after the first one, and he never missed a note." The video premiered in late October 2002.

Five tour premieres, including "Night", "Something In The Night", "She's The One" and an incredible solo piano "Incident On 57th Street". "Mary's Place" includes "Turn On Your Love Light" and "Baby, I've Been Missing You". Set also includes a super long version of "Kansas City", which was wonderful and seemed unrehearsed. It was so spontaneous that he went to Clarence Clemons for a solo, and Clarence struggled to get something going. Then Bruce had to tell the sound guy to turn up Clarence so we could hear him. Bruce was cracking up as Clarence struggled to get through a solo with his baritone sax. On the next solo break, Bruce called for Steve Van Zandt, and it took two or three notes before the sound guy got Steve above the mix. This version of "Kansas City" included the band walking off the stage singing the "bye bye" refrain while Roy Bittan was left at the piano. Roy just stayed there by himself for a good five minutes. I wondered if Roy was going to end the song and walk off. Finally, Bruce and band snuck up stage right behind Roy and they resumed. Jon Landau had a guitar when the band came back on stage, and he joined Bruce at the microphone for a verse. Landau didn't sing. I've seen Bruce do "Kansas City" before at the Kemper. In 1984, Max Weinberg told me after the show that they hadn't rehearsed the song. But they had talked about doing it.

The encores bring Eddie Vedder to the stage for a "My Hometown" duet. "Jackson Cage" finally makes it to the tour proper (and, along with "The Ties That Bind", makes for two River songs in the first five slots). "She's the One" is in the set for the second night running, as is a solo piano slot: in Kansas City it was "Incident On 57th Street"; in Chicago it's the tour debut of "For You", with Soozie and Patti providing backing vocals. "Mary's Place" includes "Turn On Your Love Light" and "Baby, I've Been Missing You". Bruce sings a couple lines of "My Kind Of Town" as he leaves stage.

Audience tape and IEM. Available on CDR 'Picking up Steam in Chi-Town'. Quality is good but there is a fair amount of echo on the recording. The show is also now found on a IEM/aud mix in the Uber series 'A Great Night In Chicago' (Uber #41, Ev2).

Final song is a cover of "Dirty Water" with Peter Wolf, which is the first time it has been played in full at a regular concert - one previous rendition was performed with Cats on a Smooth Surface at The Stone Pony, Asbury Park on April 8, 1984. Information regarding the soundcheck from a fan present "I attended the soundcheck before the show. They performed "The Rising", "Lonesome Day", "Dirty Water" (four times, the first time with Steve Van Zandt doing the lyrics because Bruce kept screwing them up...they also were testing the different lights for the song and practiced having the band walk off stage while Max Weinberg kept the song going then coming back onstage with the lights off and kicking back into the song...it was incredible to watch all this in an empty arena). They also performed "Empty Sky" and "You're Missing".

Soundcheck: LONESOME DAY (x3) / YOU'RE MISSING / MY HOMETOWN / YOU'RE MISSING / MY HOMETOWN

LONESOME DAY / YOU'RE MISSING

Bruce and the band appear on Saturday Night Live. The show is hosted by actor Matt Damon. "Lonesome Day" is with the band, "You're Missing" is solo piano. Bruce and the E Street Band are rehearsing for their performance later that evening on Saturday Night Live. They start playing "Lonesome Day" and a couple minutes into the song Bruce and Steven realize that Patti is missing. She shows up and grabs a guitar halfway into the song. After the song is over, Patti isn’t too happy and Bruce says, “There are too many members in the E Street Band now.” He then says to Patti: “I was as surprised as you were, darling.

The third annual Light of Day Benefit has its third straight appearance from Springsteen. Held once again at the Tradewinds in Sea Bright, the Light of Day show brought together a host of Jersey-style rockers to benefit the Parkinson's Disease Foundation (and celebrate organizer Bob Benjamin's birthday while they were at it). Springsteen came on at 10:40 to play for nearly an hour with Joe Grushecky and The Houserockers, on a few of their songs. They are joined by Garland Jeffreys for "96 Tears" and "Wild in the Streets," and by Gary U.S. Bonds for a set-closing "The Twist - Peppermint Twist" medley. But that wasn't all from the Boss. In the midnight hour, he comes back to the stage to play "Jole Blon" and "Quarter to Three - Having A Party" with Bonds. With the Tradewinds scheduled to close, this is the last Light of Day benefit to be held there.

Set includes tour premiere "Cadillac Ranch" and another solo piano "Incident On 57th Street". "The Fuse" returns to the set for the first time since the European shows. Bruce took a near tragic fall during "Waitin’ On A Sunny Day". "Mary's Place" includes "The Monkey Time" and "Baby, I've Been Missing You". "Ramrod" includes a couple lines from "Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey!" in the outro. Here’s an eye witness account by HazyDavy: "We were low in Section 128 behind Roy and directly facing the end corner of the back ramp (stage left) where Bruce came to sing during "Waitin' On A Sunny Day". Bruce left there a tad late and rushed to head back to the center ramp (on Max’s right) to return to the stage but he turned one step too soon. Luckily, as he strode forward, his right leg landed on the down-ramp first but when he went to land his left leg, it hit nothing but air as it completely missed the ramp. He had not been looking down. He fell on the ramp, precariously more half-off than half-on. Luckily, being right handed paid off as the microphone was in that hand and his left hand was free to try to grab on to something so he wouldn’t fall completely to the floor and possibly injure himself really bad. He fell far enough forward that his left hand actually caught hold on the edge of Max’s drum stand – that saved him. Remember Patti Smith's fall off the stage in 1977 when she broke her neck? Ever the consummate performer, Bruce bounced right back up and made it back to center stage to hit his cue, almost without skipping a beat. Most people in the front part of the house probably had no clue as to the fall or the averted tragedy until, as pointed out in the Backstreets fanzine, they saw the cut and blood on his arm on the video screen. We just looked at each other in stunned silence for a minute or two and pointed to what we had just seen. We noticed others behind the stage who had seen it were also pointing to where the fall had happened. Bruce was a Lucky Man indeed in Greensboro this night.

Bono (of U2) and Dave Stewart (of the Eurythmics) joins on "Because the Night", with Bono adding vocals (including some unique lyrics in the outro) and Stewart contributing a guitar solo. Dion lends his vocals to a performance of "If I Should Fall Behind", which sounds more like the 1996 tour version than the 1999-2000 tour arrangement. And in a very cool appearance, Vincent Pastore ("Big Pussy" from "The Sopranos") comes on-stage to introduce the encores. "Mary's Place" includes "The Monkey Time" and "Baby, I've Been Missing You".

Great show. "The River" and "Growin’ Up" are full band arrangements. "Badlands" sees the double ending again. "Mary’s Place" includes "The Monkey Time", "Dancing In The Street", and "Baby, I've Been Missing You". "Detroit Medley" gets a rare outing. "Twist And Shout" sees the band ending the song, leaving the stage, only to return doing the song as the crowd won’t stop chanting. First ever performance in Sweden of "Growin' Up".

Audience tape, IEM and IEM/AUD mixes. This show is available on the Crystal Cat release 'Midsummer Second Night' in stellar sound. Also available as a purported soundboard recording 'Down In The Gothenburg' (sic) from Social Graces, although it's almost certainly an IEM. Several IEM/AUD mixes also circulate, which go some way to reducing the sterility of the straight IEM.

The show opened with "The Promised Land" and again included the full-band "The River" in place of "You're Missing." Bruce also dropped a good portion of "Roll Over Beethoven" into "Ramrod" for the Viennese crowd. "Born In The U.S.A." from the soundcheck is solo acoustic. First ever performances in Austria of "The Rising", "Lonesome Day", "My Love Will Not Let You Down", "Empty Sky", "Waitin' On A Sunny Day", "Worlds Apart", "Mary's Place", "Incident On 57th Street", "Into The Fire", "Ramrod - Roll Over Beethoven", "My City Of Ruins", "Glory Days", and "Dancing In The Dark".

Tour premieres of "Tunnel Of Love" and "Mansion On The Hill" and a rare "Leap Of Faith" add also to this stand out show. "Tunnel Of Love" was last performed at the Oakland Human Rights Now! / Amnesty International concert in 1988 and is only played four times this tour.

PINK CADILLAC

Springsteen overdubs backing vocals for a Jerry Lee Lewis cover of Bruce’s song. The basic track had been recorded by Lewis in another studio some months earlier – Bruce merely added his parts at his home studio.

Springsteen’s contribution was one of the first completed for a work-in-progress album that turned out to be the much-delayed album Last Man Standing, released on September 26, 2006.

SANTA CLAUS IS COMIN' TO TOWN

Funeral for legendary Wall Street trader John Mulheren, who Bruce and Patti had known since the 1960s. John Mulheren’s sister (Patti Mulheren Skinner) had been the lead singer from 1968-1970 in Gross National Product, a band that had performed at gigs alongside early Springsteen outfits The Castiles and Earth. At the request of John’s widow, Bruce performed a solo, acoustic rendition of "Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town". Nils Lofgren also performed.

CAN’T TEACH AN OLD DOG NEW TRICKS

The recording was released in June 2004 as part of Gary’s album Back In 20.


2004-03-15 - WALDORF-ASTORIA HOTEL, NEW YORK CITY, NY

Bruce inducts Jackson Browne into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at a ceremony in New York City. In his speech, Bruce recalled first seeing Browne at the Bitter End in the early seventies after he played his own set at Max's Kansas City. He also noted that the audiences the two drew were a little different. "Jackson Browne was a bona fide rock'n'roll sex star", said Springsteen. "Now, being a little competitive, I also noticed that while the E Street Band and I were sweatin' our asses off for hours just to put some fannies in the seats, that obviously due to what must have been some strong homo-erotic undercurrent in our music, we were drawing rooms filled with men. Not that great lookin' men either. Meanwhile, Jackson is drawing more women than an Indigo Girls show!" Bruce did not perform at the ceremony, which featured performances by Browne, Prince and Bob Seger.

2004-06-29 - THE ANTRIM RESIDENCE, RED BANK, NJ

JAM MEDLEY / THE PROMISED LAND

A truly unique moment in Springsteen history. In December 2002 young Michael Antrim had submitted a painting of Springsteen as part of a Freehold Library Art Contest – his submission won the best-in-show award. Springsteen only belatedly found out about it (and that Michael had always wanted the item autographed). So Bruce went over to the family home alone to sign it. Once inside Bruce learned that Michael was a budding guitarist and that Michael had an acoustic and an electric guitar handy – so Bruce said “let’s play”. The two jammed in the living room and Bruce also gave a solo rendition of “The Promised Land”. All up Bruce spent about 90-minutes at the home.

Tour premiere for "Atlantic City" and live debut of "Froggie Went A Courtin'". It seems that Bruce had no intention of playing the latter. The original setlist that was on the lightboard showed that he was intending to play "Devils & Dust". A seven-year old boy in the front row waved a stuffed animal frog at Bruce. He went up to take the toy and motioned as if he was going to sign it for him. The kid told him that he wanted to hear “Froggie” to which the Boss sheepishly looked down and laughed…. “Uh…..we don’t play that one ……….” After a bit of chiding from the pit crowd… Bruce looked back at the band and asked if they could play that one….. who’s gonna argue with the Boss!?…. To which Bruce laughed as he strapped on his harmonica……”That’s what I like….confidence from the band…..” (sarcastically). “Okay, this one goes out to ………what’s your name?……. kid says “RIVER”………. Bruce: (laughing) “Yeah, I got another song for you too”. Patti Scialfa is not present. Horn section is Baron-Manion-Pender-Rosenberg.

E Street Band member Roy Bittan makes a guest appearance for "Pay Me My Money Down". As the rest of the band file out to end the song, Roy keeps playing along with the drums and tuba; after Bruce drags Larry Eagle and Art Baron away, it's just the Professor all by himself, banging it out on the old upright. Bruce hangs out next to the piano with a huge grin on his face, yelling stuff at Roy off mic, and for the big finish Bruce plays the last chord along with him, dragging his elbow down the keyboard - courtesy backstreets.com. The Greek Theatre is an outdoor amphitheatre. Horn section is Baron-Manion-Pender-Rosenberg.

Benefit concert in aid of renovations for the venue. A show that will be long remembered - in a unique presentation - Bruce and the band run through the entire Darkness On The Edge Of Town and Born To Run albums in order, as close to the original recordings as possible. Mark Pender guests on trumpet for "Meeting Across the River;" a full horn section (consisting of Pender on trumpet, Richie "La Bamba" Rosenberg on trombone, and Jerry Vivino and Ed Manion on saxophones) joins the band on "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out" and the encores. A test run, perhaps, for what would become a regular occurrence towards the end of the Working On A Dream tour.

Wow, what a show. Has to go down as one of the best of the Reunion era with all sorts of surprises. Premieres for four classic covers - "Then She Kissed Me" opens, last played exactly 33 years ago in Atlanta. "Mountain Of Love" (also 33 years away), a snatch of "Not Fade Away" as intro to "She's The One" recalls 1978, and finally "Little Queenie", one of three songs played after "American Land". "For You" is the full band version, and the set also includes "Adam Raised A Cain", "Rendezvous", "Cover Me", and "Drive All Night". "Mary's Place" includes "The Monkey Time". "Rendezvous", "For You", "Mountain Of Love", "Backstreets", "Drive All Night", and "Little Queenie" are played by sign request. During the soundcheck, Bruce sings a snippet of "Living In The U.S.A." before "Little Queenie". Patti Scialfa is not present.

Audience tape and multi-channel IEM/AUD mixes. The audience tape is available on CDR 'All The Stars Shining' (Ev2) and CDs 'Lying in the Heat of the Night' (Godfather) and 'St. Louis Magic Night' (Crystal Cat). The Ev2 version is probably best of the bunch, but still doesn't do a remarkable show justice. Two multi-channel IEM/AUD mixes circulate. The first, 'St. Louis 2008 - 8' (Ev2), utilises eight IEM channels. The second, released by Hoserama in April 2015, is a mix of eight IEM feeds, ALD, and two audience recordings. Hoserama took well over a year to create the mix, and it shows - it's by far the best representation of a great night. As a bonus, it also includes the soundcheck.

Another fine show, if not up to the standard of the previous night. Final official show of the Magic tour. "Ricky Wants A Man Of Her Own" is the big surprise, a River outtake never before played. The Shirelles' "Boys" was sung by Max: now that's a first. The song was also covered by The Beatles, sung by Ringo Starr. "It's All Over Now" is a duet with Soozie Tyrell. A solo acoustic "Devils & Dust" is the first song on the tour from that album, and "Cynthia" is played for the second time this tour, the first in 2008. Two more premieres in the encores - "Save The Last Dance For Me" and "Rockin' All Over The World". "Mary's Place" includes "The Monkey Time". "4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)" features the waitress lyrics. "Cadillac Ranch", "Working On The Highway", and "Rockin' All Over The World" are played by sign request. "Boys" in in response to a sign to "let Max sing"; "4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)" is in response to a sea of "thank you" signs held up at the start of the encore. Patti Scialfa is not present.

Closed rehearsal with Springsteen and the E Street Band along with the backing singers. "Sufferin' In The Land" is the Jimmy Cliff song - this rehearsal is the only time it is known to have been played, and seems to unusually feature Roy Bittan on alto saxophone.

Various IEM tapes in circulation. An excellent quality IEM recording of the (possibly) complete rehearsal is available on four-CD set '2009 Tour Rehearsals' from Social Graces - a fascinating glimpse of the band at work behind closed doors, although it does seem that a fair amount of between song chatter has been removed. "Outlaw Pete" is a bonus track on the CD 'Innocent And Glory Days' (Social Graces), also an IEM.

2011-03-00 - RENEGADE NATION STUDIO, NEW YORK CITY, NY

Bruce makes his debut appearance on Steve Van Zandt's Little Steven's Underground Garage radio show. The interview was broadcast in three parts on April 1, 8 and 15 on over 200 terrestrial FM radio stations across the United States. More an informal, spontaneous chat between friends than an interview, the show was recorded some time in March at Van Zandt's office studio at Renegade Nation in Manhattan's Greenwich Village and celebrates the ninth anniversary of Underground Garage.

Topics included in the show are wide ranging, but primarily cover Bruce and Steve's musical influences between 1963 and 1969. They initially talk about Elvis Presley, The Beatles, Bruce learning how to play his first guitar, "Twist And Shout", The Animals (Bruce plays his guitar to demonstrate the similarity between "Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood", "Prove It All Night" and "Badlands"), The Kinks and The Yardbirds. Discussing guitar playing, Bruce brings up Teddy Spelios, who was in a group called The Source and could play like Jeff Beck. He was able to produce a sound that Bruce was unable to match, until he purchased a guitar from an ex-marine with a long neck and no strings that was able to produce "the first distortion on the shore," and he was finally able to replicate the sound of "Sunshine Of Your Love". It wasn't until some time later that he found out it was actually a bass guitar. They then talk about Bob Dylan, the British Invasion, The Rolling Stones, and The Who. They discuss Them, and how Bruce (with The Castiles) performed their show-stopper "Mystic Eyes" at a Battle Of The Bands contest in 1966. Click the date/location link above for a full transcript of the interview.

2012-02-16 - THÉÂTRE MARIGNY, PARIS, FRANCE

Bruce flies to Paris to promote his new album Wrecking Ball. He is interviewed on stage in front of an audience of journalists from across Europe by journalist (and friend) Antoine de Caunes. Not for the first time - de Caunes has interviewed Springsteen on several occasions in the past. It appears that journalists knew about this just couple of days earlier and only learnt the location of the press conference in the bus that drove them from Sony HQ to the theatre. Track-by-track reviews of the album appeared in several newspapers in the days following the event. Portions of the interview are later incorporated into a Thom Zimny-edited documentary titled Wrecking Ball: A Conversation With Bruce Springsteen. The 22-minute film is released to various news-outlets around the world on June 18, 2012.

This is a reprise of his 2010 appearance on Late Night, when they performed "Whip My Hair" together. Following an interview, Bruce and the E Street Band are joined by Tom Morello for the live premieres of "Death To My Hometown" and "Jack Of All Trades", accompanied by the tour horn section of Curt Ramm, Barry Danielian, Ed Manion, Jake Clemons and Clark Gayton. Show closer is an uproarious "The E Street Shuffle" with the E Street Band, Tom Morello and The Roots.

"My City Of Ruins" features band introductions, including Patti singing a snippet of "People Get Ready". Bruce sings a line from "Sexy And I Know It" during the intro to "The E Street Shuffle". "Mansion On The Hill" is played acoustically on guitar and harmonica, with Patti on harmony vocals and Soozie on fiddle. First ever performance of The Temptations' 1964 hit "The Way You Do the Things You Do", played in tribute (along with Wilson Pickett's "634-5789 (Soulsville, U.S.A.)", which sees Bruce up on the balcony of the theatre) to all the soul legends who have performed on stage at Harlem's Apollo Theater. "Land Of Hope And Dreams" is in a new live arrangement in the style of the Wrecking Ball version, beginning with a choral "this train" introduction and concluding with "People Get Ready", including Curtis Mayfield's original lyric "don't need no ticket / you just thank the Lord." There's also a moving tribute to Clarence Clemons during "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out", with the band pausing after "the big man joined the band" for a wave of applause, before crashing back into the song. Michelle Moore (who sings on the album) provides the "rap" vocals for "Rocky Ground". Live premieres for "Shackled And Drawn", "We Are Alive", and "Rocky Ground". The show is also filmed, perhaps for future use - pro-shot video of the entire "Death To My Hometown" is posted online, plus partial versions of "We Take Care Of Our Own" and "Wrecking Ball".

2012-03-15 - AUSTIN CONVENTION CENTER, AUSTIN, TX

Springsteen delivers the keynote speech at the South By Southwest music festival. Arriving on stage 35 minutes later than the scheduled 12pm, he begins by saying "Good morning. Why are we up so fucking early? How important can this speech be if we're giving it at noon, when every decent musician in town is asleep." He primarily speaks about his musical influences, singing one verse and the chorus of The Animals' "We Gotta Get Out Of This Place" and leading the crowd in a partial singalong of Woody Guthrie's "This Land Is Your Land". He also gives mention to Elvis Presley, Roy Orbison, The Beatles, Sex Pistols, Bob Dylan and Pete Seeger during his hour-long speech before leaving the stage to a standing ovation. Video and audio of the speech were broadcast on the SXSW and NPR websites.

Internet broadcast circulates readily on CD (by Hrubesh, LB1999 and Bill Horton) and DVD.

Tickets were only available via raffle to festival badgeholders who applied on the South By Southwest website. The final warm-up show features a 24-song set with plenty of special guests. Jimmy Cliff shares the stage with Bruce & The E Street Band for three songs, surprisingly "Trapped" is not among them. "Many Rivers To Cross" was played regularly during the 1993 leg of the 1992-93 World Tour; "Time Will Tell" was also played on that tour and makes it's U.S. debut here. The Animals' Eric Burdon performs with Springsteen for the first time in an appearance that was arranged following Bruce's passionate speech about The Animals' influence on his music.

Tour) closes the set, with the accompaniment of Joe Ely, Alejandro Escovedo, Tom Morello, Garland Jeffreys, Arcade Fire, and The Low Anthem. "My City Of Ruins" includes "People Get Ready".

Although "She's The One" was on the handwritten setlist, it is replaced by "Lonesome Day". Bruce does a bit of crowd-surfing during "634-5789 (Soulsville, U.S.A.)". Live debut of "Easy Money", and the first appearances this year of "Born To Run", "Dancing In The Dark" and "American Land". "My City Of Ruins" includes "People Get Ready".

The "Apollo Medley" (as Bruce refers to it on the setlist) of "The Way You Do The Things You Do" and "634-5789 (Soulsville, U.S.A.)" remains in the set. "My City Of Ruins" includes "People Get Ready".

2012-03-23 - TAMPA BAY TIMES FORUM, TAMPA, FL

Soundcheck: AMERICAN SKIN (41 SHOTS) / DOES THIS BUS STOP AT 82ND STREET? / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / ATLANTIC CITY / EASY MONEY / WE TAKE CARE OF OUR OWN / ROCKY GROUND

WE TAKE CARE OF OUR OWN / WRECKING BALL / PROVE IT ALL NIGHT / DEATH TO MY HOMETOWN / MY CITY OF RUINS / DOES THIS BUS STOP AT 82ND STREET? / TALK TO ME / JACK OF ALL TRADES / ATLANTIC CITY / EASY MONEY / WAITIN' ON A SUNNY DAY / THE PROMISED LAND / THE WAY YOU DO THE THINGS YOU DO - 634-5789 (SOULSVILLE, U.S.A.) / AMERICAN SKIN (41 SHOTS) / RADIO NOWHERE / THE RISING / WE ARE ALIVE / THUNDER ROAD / ROCKY GROUND / LAND OF HOPE AND DREAMS - PEOPLE GET READY / BORN TO RUN / DANCING IN THE DARK / GLORY DAYS / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT (with Jarod Clemons)

Third show of the tour and Bruce really mixes it up with no less than seven tour premieres, only the third time this has ever happened. "Talk To Me" is the first song from The Promise (not including "Because The Night") to make the setlist; this is also the first time it has been played in concert with the E Street Band and the first time it has been performed outside of New Jersey. Click the link above to hear it. Bruce calls "Talk To Me" as an audible - replacing "Spirit In The Night" on the setlist. "Prove It All Night" is in the third slot in place of "Badlands" which is dropped - also a rare occurrence. "My City Of Ruins" includes "People Get Ready". "American Skin (41 Shots)" is played without comment, but undoubtedly in reference to the shooting of Trayvon Martin. Clarence Clemons's son Jarod joins on tambourine and backup vocals for "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out". "Talk To Me" and "Glory Days" are played by sign request.

Audience tapes (by Travitz and Vegetated, Duke Remaster available of last source). Pro-shot video of "American Skin (41 Shots)" is posted on YouTube and Bruce's official website.

2012-03-28 - WELLS FARGO CENTER, PHILADELPHIA, PA

Soundcheck: THUNDERCRACK / SEASIDE BAR SONG / NO SURRENDER

WE TAKE CARE OF OUR OWN / WRECKING BALL / BADLANDS / DEATH TO MY HOMETOWN / MY CITY OF RUINS / SEASIDE BAR SONG / DOES THIS BUS STOP AT 82ND STREET? / JACK OF ALL TRADES / ATLANTIC CITY / EASY MONEY / SHE'S THE ONE / WAITIN' ON A SUNNY DAY / THE PROMISED LAND / THE WAY YOU DO THE THINGS YOU DO - 634-5789 (SOULSVILLE, U.S.A.) / AMERICAN SKIN (41 SHOTS) / LONESOME DAY / THE RISING / WE ARE ALIVE / THUNDER ROAD / ROCKY GROUND / LAND OF HOPE AND DREAMS - PEOPLE GET READY / BORN TO RUN / DANCING IN THE DARK / RAISE YOUR HAND / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT

First of two nights in Philadelphia. A rare performance of "Seaside Bar Song" appears in what is becoming an "early classic" slot after "My City Of Ruins", which includes "People Get Ready". The outtake from The Wild, The Innocent & The E Street Shuffle was last played in 2009, in the same city. Bruce remembered playing it at The Main Point in Bryn Mawr - he's probably right, but sadly we have no record of it as there are many unknown setlists from shows there. Next up is "Does This Bus Stop At 82nd Street?", featuring a drum-off between Max and percussionist Everett Bradley. "Waitin' On A Sunny Day" includes a drum-led introduction, used during this and the following six shows. Bruce explicitly dedicates "American Skin (41 Shots)" to Trayvon Martin. While climbing in the crowd during "Raise Your Hand", Bruce takes a seat in the crowd and downs a beer handed to him by a fan.

Second of two nights in Philadelphia. The first of five tour premieres is "Night", which replaces "Badlands". "Thundercrack" is played, granting the wish of a young girl who held up a sign with "Please play Thundercrack for my dad in Iraq". "Trapped" and "Darkness On The Edge Of Town" make their tour debuts, as does "Streets Of Philadelphia". The latter has only been played four times (not including off-tour performances) since 2002, all of which were in Philadelphia. A 14-minute horn-laden "Kitty's Back" is the highlight of the encores. "My City Of Ruins" includes "People Get Ready". The girl that danced with Bruce the night before climbed on stage by herself at the beginning of "Dancing in the Dark", but was set back by Bruce. Bruce had another girl in mind to dance with: his mother Adele.

Washington gets three tour premieres in a 26-song set clocking in at just short of three hours. The highlight is the full-band "The Promise", only played twice before; at the opening concert of the Darkness Tour in 1978 and then years later at the Asbury Park Carousel in 2010. "Adam Raised A Cain and "Out In The Street" are the other tour premieres. "Land Of Hope And Dreams" returns to the set, along with the pairing of "Seaside Bar Song" and "Does This Bus Stop At 82nd Street?". Bruce has a close call while crowd surfing during "634-5789 (Soulsville, U.S.A.)" as the crowd nearly drops him. "My City Of Ruins" includes "People Get Ready".

A 25-song set with the tour premiere of "So Young And In Love". "Badlands" returns after two shows off. "My City Of Ruins" includes "People Get Ready". The encores are a repeat of the previous show in Washington. For the first time on the tour, and one of only two times during the first American leg, the "this train" introduction is dropped from "Land Of Hope And Dreams".

Soundcheck: INCIDENT ON 57TH STREET

BADLANDS / WE TAKE CARE OF OUR OWN / WRECKING BALL / OUT IN THE STREET / DEATH TO MY HOMETOWN / MY CITY OF RUINS / MURDER INCORPORATED / JOHNNY 99 / JACK OF ALL TRADES / SHACKLED AND DRAWN / LION'S DEN / EASY MONEY / WAITIN' ON A SUNNY DAY / THE PROMISED LAND / THE WAY YOU DO THE THINGS YOU DO - 634-5789 (SOULSVILLE, U.S.A.) / AMERICAN SKIN (41 SHOTS) / LONESOME DAY / THE RISING / WE ARE ALIVE / THUNDER ROAD / ROCKY GROUND / KITTY'S BACK / BORN TO RUN / DANCING IN THE DARK / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT

First night in New York and Madison Square Garden is treated to a 2 hours 45 minute show with two tour premieres including perhaps the biggest surprise of the tour to date, "Lion's Den", which has only been played three times previously on the Reunion tour. Bruce and Band enter the stage with the lights on and the music of "New York, New York" playing. Surprisingly "Badlands" opens the set, displacing "We Take Care Of Our Own" which has been ever-present in that slot so far. An excellent "Murder Incorporated" is the other tour debut. "My City Of Ruins" includes "People Get Ready". "Shackled And Drawn" makes a welcome return, and the encores include "Kitty's Back".

Second night in New York features the tour premieres of "Backstreets" and "Spirit In The Night", two highlights of a set that clocks in at just over three hours. Just like the first night Bruce and Band enter the stage with the lights on and "New York, New York" playing. Once again "Badlands" opens the set. "My City Of Ruins" includes "People Get Ready". "Thundercrack" is played by sign request.

WE TAKE CARE OF OUR OWN / WRECKING BALL / BADLANDS / DEATH TO MY HOMETOWN / MY CITY OF RUINS / THE E STREET SHUFFLE / CANDY'S ROOM / JACK OF ALL TRADES / TRAPPED / YOUNGSTOWN / SHE'S THE ONE / WAITIN' ON A SUNNY DAY / THE PROMISED LAND / THE WAY YOU DO THE THINGS YOU DO - 634-5789 (SOULSVILLE, U.S.A.) / INCIDENT ON 57TH STREET / AMERICAN SKIN (41 SHOTS) / BECAUSE THE NIGHT / THE RISING / WE ARE ALIVE / LAND OF HOPE AND DREAMS - PEOPLE GET READY / THUNDER ROAD / ROCKY GROUND / OUT IN THE STREET / BORN TO RUN / DANCING IN THE DARK / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT

A 3 hour 11 minutes show with the tour premieres of "Youngstown" and "Incident On 57th Street". Curiously Bruce decides to skip the guitar solo at the end of the latter, instead signaling to Roy Bittan to play the piano coda and end the song. "Waitin' On A Sunny Day" begins with Bruce and Steve on acoustic guitars, as it will for the remainder of the tour. Patti Scialfa is not present, and perhaps not coincidentally "Easy Money" is dropped from the set for the first time. According to Bruce she had to make sure the kids were taking their own drugs. "I love you, old Michigan, and I know where the fuck I am!", refers to the Auburn Hills show of late 2009 when Bruce several times mistakenly called out Ohio instead of Michigan. According to reports, the lengthy soundcheck included extensive rehearsals of Marvin Gaye's "Can I Get A Witness".

Bruce and band, without Patti Scialfa, enter the stage with "Buffalo Gals" playing over the PA - Bruce even sings a few lines. Three tour firsts: "Rendezvous", "Mountain Of Love" (only known to have been played nine times since 1975) and "Point Blank". Tonight is Max Weinberg's 61st birthday, so he gets to play "Ramrod" (his favourite song) in the encores.

Bruce and band, once again without Patti, enter the stage to the theme of "The Magnificent Seven". Albany sees three tour premieres. A solo acoustic version of "Janey, Don't You Lose Heart" is played by sign request - "We haven't played this one in a long time. This is for Molly, in memory of her mom Janey." In the encores Molly was pulled on stage to dance with Bruce. "Two Hearts", "The River", "American Skin (41 Shots)" and "Sherry Darling" were all on the setlist but not played.

Patti is absent once more. Two songs make their tour debuts, "My Love Will Not Let You Down" and "Light of Day". The latter includes the "Land Of 1000 Daces" chant, followed by a verse or two of "You Can't Sit Down" inserted in the middle. "Light Of Day" closes the main set, just as it did throughout the 1999/2000 Reunion Tour. Bruce and Stevie collect two signs from the crowd; "Bruce for President" and "Van Zandt for VP", they respond with "Yes we f*cking can!". Set features the 600th confirmed performance of "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out".

A 2¾ hour show with a not-so-surprising guest appearance by Tom Morello on several songs, one of which is the tour premiere of "The Ghost Of Tom Joad". "California Sun" is the third cover performed during the Wrecking Ball tour so far. Originally credited to Henry Glover and Morris Levy, the surf classic has been covered by many artists including The Rivieras and Dick Dale. Incidentally, Springsteen gives a shout out to Dick Dale during "Paradise By The "C"" at the Roxy Theatre in 1978. Set also features a landmark - the 1000th recorded performance of "The Promised Land". Bruce dances with his youngest sister Pamela during "Dancing In The Dark", and Patti is present again after a absence of five shows. "My City Of Ruins" includes "People Get Ready".

Early-birds in the LA Sports Arena get an unexpected treat - an hour before the show Bruce appears on stage with a party (Bruce claimed they were his relatives, but we're not so sure!) and plays an acoustic version of "For You". This kind of event isn't unprecedented - Paris in 2003, for example. The three-hour set opens with "No Surrender", the first of two tour premieres from Born In The U.S.A. - "Bobby Jean" is the other. The "this train" introduction is dropped from "Land Of Hope And Dreams" for the second and final time of the first American leg. Tom Morello joins Bruce on stage for the same songs as the previous night, plus "Land of Hope And Dreams". Springsteen's guitar tech Kevin Buell is honoured on the occasion of his 1000th show - Bruce lures him to the front of the stage with a fake guitar failure. "My City Of Ruins" includes "People Get Ready".

Springsteen plays The New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival for the second time. Kicking off at 4.43pm due to the traditional 7pm curfew, several songs from We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions make their tour debuts in a set that clocks in at just over two-and-a-half hours. The Apollo Medley is skipped for the first time this tour. Dr. John joins Bruce on stage for "Something You Got", a song that has been covered before between 1972 and 1974. "Rocky Ground" includes a full version of "When The Saints Go Marching In" at the end. Patti Scialfa is absent once again.

Another oldie follows straight after, "It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City". The last, The Band's "The Weight", is played in memory of the late Levon Helm. "My City Of Ruins" includes a snippet of "Sad Mood". Also in the 26-song set: "No Surrender" opens, a great pairing of "Candy's Room" and "She's The One", and the second "Talk To Me" of the tour. Patti Scialfa is again absent.

Warm-up rehearsal / soundcheck the day before the European tour begins, with guests and journalists present. "Thunder Road" is dedicated to fans who managed to find their way to the upper levels of the stadium. "The Promise" is in the full-band arrangement. Following the conclusion of the rehearsal Bruce holds an interview session with the press.

Start of the European leg of the "Wrecking Ball" tour

2012-05-13 - ESTADIO OLIMPICO DE LA CARTUJA, SEVILLE, SPAIN

BADLANDS / WE TAKE CARE OF OUR OWN / WRECKING BALL / THE TIES THAT BIND / DEATH TO MY HOMETOWN / MY CITY OF RUINS / TRAPPED / OUT IN THE STREET / JACK OF ALL TRADES / CANDY'S ROOM / SHE'S THE ONE / DARLINGTON COUNTY / SHACKLED AND DRAWN / WAITIN' ON A SUNNY DAY / THE PROMISED LAND / THE WAY YOU DO THE THINGS YOU DO - 634-5789 (SOULSVILLE, U.S.A.) / BECAUSE THE NIGHT / THE RISING / LONESOME DAY / WE ARE ALIVE / LAND OF HOPE AND DREAMS - PEOPLE GET READY / ROCKY GROUND / I'M GOIN' DOWN / BORN TO RUN / DANCING IN THE DARK / BOBBY JEAN / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT

A three hour, 27-song set opens the European leg of the tour. Bruce and the band enter the stage to the theme from The Good, The Bad & The Ugly. Set includes the first "I'm Goin' Down" of the tour - no great surprise, since it was rehearsed the previous day. During "My City Of Ruins" the lines "Are we missing anybody? If you're here, and we're here, they're here", were spoken in Spanish. Bruce was clearly moved when the crowd started cheering for Clarence. The guitar-intro of "Wrecking Ball" features extra improvisation by Bruce. Trapped is played by request of a 14-year-old boy. Despite the half-stadium configuration, the show is relatively poorly attended with plenty of empty space around the arena. European debuts of "We Take Care Of Our Own", "Wrecking Ball", "Death To My Hometown", "Jack Of All Trades", "Shackled And Drawn", the "Apollo Medley", "We Are Alive", and "Rocky Ground". As well as "Rocky Ground", Michelle Moore also sings on the 'Apollo Medley' and "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out" for the first time. The printed setlist is reported to have included "The Promise" and "The E Street Shuffle". Patti Scialfa is not present.

BADLANDS / WE TAKE CARE OF OUR OWN / WRECKING BALL / NO SURRENDER / DEATH TO MY HOMETOWN / MY CITY OF RUINS / OUT IN THE STREET / TALK TO ME / JACK OF ALL TRADES / YOUNGSTOWN / MURDER INCORPORATED / JOHNNY 99 / YOU CAN LOOK (BUT YOU BETTER NOT TOUCH) / SHE'S THE ONE / SHACKLED AND DRAWN / WAITIN' ON A SUNNY DAY / THE PROMISED LAND / THE RIVER / PROVE IT ALL NIGHT / HUNGRY HEART / THE RISING / WE ARE ALIVE / THUNDER ROAD / ROCKY GROUND / BORN IN THE U.S.A. / BORN TO RUN / BOBBY JEAN / DANCING IN THE DARK / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT

What to say? The longest show of the tour to date with 29 songs over three hours ten minutes. Two tour premieres, but the big news is the return of the piano and guitar introduction to "Prove It All Night", made famous during the Darkness On The Edge Of Town Tour of 1978. It was also played twice in 1980, but never since, and never before in Europe. Also, possibly for the first time, Steve takes the closing guitar solo. It was played as a request for a group of fans with a sign that read "With Intro 78 Prove it all night". Click the date/location link above to hear it. Start of the show can be watched on TV3alacarta. Set also features the European debut of "Talk To Me". "Born In The U.S.A." remains in the encores. The "Apollo Medley" is dropped - the first time this has happened, other than the shortened festival set in New Orleans. Donna Summer's "Last Dance" is played as the band take to the stage. "My City Of Ruins" includes a snippet of "Sad Mood". The chain-gang style call and response introduction to "Shackled And Drawn", debuted in Las Palmas, is extended, with Bruce singing, "Work all day I wanna hear you holler, workin' all day for a dime and a dollar". Tour premiere "Hungry Heart" includes a somewhat unusual improvised sax solo. The soundcheck featured Bruce and the band working on an unknown gospel song with the singers - you can find a recording of the song on the detail page. Patti Scialfa is not present.

Audience tapes (Carbobueno, Fortylicks (two different versions), Javichun and Zimmy21). A fourteen-track multi-cam Blu-ray (DVD Dubbing Guy) circulates, which also includes thirteen tracks from the second show.

Springsteen and the band headline Pinkpop Festival, just as they did in 2009. Somewhat truncated 23-song set to fit into the festival time-slot with two tour premieres, "I'm On Fire" and "96 Tears" with the E Street Band backing Garland Jeffreys. "Jack Of All Trades" is dropped from the set for the first time. Bruce and the Band are joined by the brilliant Mumford & Sons for "Hungry Heart". The British folk-rock band played the same stage earlier in the evening, with Bruce and Jake watching from the side of the stage. An eventful "Spirit In The Night" sees Bruce forgetting the words (he's assisted by a guy in the front row) and tripping over a speaker. He also does a little crowd surfing, but is stopped by a security officer. European debut of "96 Tears" and first ever performances in the Netherlands of "We Take Care Of Our Own", "Wrecking Ball", "Death To My Hometown", "Shackled And Drawn", and "We Are Alive". For the first time this tour, Michelle Moore joins the E Street Choir for the whole show. Patti Scialfa is not present.

Audience tape (Zimmy21). Four songs are broadcast on Dutch TV and radio: "Death To My Hometown", "Spirit In The Night", "I'm On Fire" and "Shackled And Drawn".

Also played: "Adam Raised A Cain" into "Prove It All Night" (the latter without the 1978 intro), the first ever performance in Spain of "Save My Love", and a nice pairing of "The River" and "Backstreets", the latter with a near 'Sad Eyes' interlude. Close, but not quite. "My City Of Ruins" includes a snippet of "Sad Mood". The "this train" introduction to "Land Of Hope And Dreams" is dropped for the first time since Los Angeles. Both "The Rising" and "We Are Alive" are dropped for the first time on the tour. Patti Scialfa is not present.

Bruce and band perform a 24-song set at Rock in Rio Festival, only the second time Springsteen has played in Portugal. Bruce didn't take to the stage until after midnight on the morning of June 4, and it was nearly 2.45am before he was finally done. Set closes with the tour debut of "Twist and Shout," the first time this year a show hasn't ended with "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out". Fireworks started when he finished "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out" as a form of closing the Festival. But Bruce didn't care and neither did the 81,000 people attending this show who have been waiting 19 years for his comeback. "She's The One", "I'm On Fire", and "Hungry Heart" are played by sign request. First ever performances in Portugal of "We Take Care Of Our Own", "Wrecking Ball", "Death To My Hometown", "My City Of Ruins", "Spirit In The Night", "No Surrender", "She's The One", "I'm On Fire", "Shackled And Drawn", "Waitin' On A Sunny Day", "The Rising", "Lonesome Day", "We Are Alive", "Dancing In The Dark", "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out", and "Twist And Shout". Patti Scialfa is not present.

No complete audio as yet. Some two hours of high definition pro-shot footage circulates, comprised of nineteen songs. The video begins with "Spirit In The Night" and is missing the first six tracks. The first verse of "Waitin' On A Sunny Day" is cut. Six songs are streamed live on the Rock in Rio Youtube channel: "Spirit In The Night", "Because The Night", "No Surrender", "She's The One", "I'm On Fire" and "Shackled And Drawn". Subsequently two more videos are posted on Youtube - "The River" and "Twist And Shout".

Bruce's fourth appearance at the famous San Siro and he produces an incredible 33-song set that clocks in at over three-and-a-half hours. This magical night in Milan is one of the longest shows Bruce has ever done, although surpassed by the Madrid and Helsinki shows performed later on this leg of the tour. The band enter the stage to the theme song from Sergio Leone's Once Upon A Time In The West. "My City Of Ruins" includes a snippet of "Sad Mood". "The Promise" is played by Bruce alone at the piano. The "this train" introduction returns for the final time during "Land Of Hope And Dreams", which closes the main set. Four tracks from Born In The U.S.A. feature in the ten-song encore. A fan holds up a request to dance with Jake Clemons, and is allowed to do so during "Dancing In The Dark". First ever performances in Italy of "We Take Care Of Our Own", "Wrecking Ball", "Death To My Hometown", "Jack Of All Trades", "Shackled And Drawn", "The Promise", "We Are Alive", and "Rocky Ground".

Another Italian marathon, this time thirty songs in two minutes short of three-and-a-half hours. Prior to the show Little Steven tweets "Are you ready for the frenzy in Firenze?". The band take the stage to Ennio Morricone's Once Upon a Time in the West. Tour premieres for "Be True" and, by sign request, "Burning Love", both of which were soundchecked a week or so ago in San Sebastian. "My City Of Ruins" includes a snippet of "Sad Mood". The "this train" introduction is once again dropped from "Land Of Hope And Dreams", not to return for the remainder of the tour. "Who'll Stop The Rain" closes the rain affected show, the first time that has happened. About halfway through the set light rain began to fall before turning torrential by the encores. "Darlington County" with the "Honky Tonk Woman" intro gets another airing, and the "Apollo Medley" returns to the set after a break of five shows. First ever performance in Italy of "Burning Love". Although Patti is in Italy, she's not on stage with the E Street Band.

Audience tapes (by Red Giant and Biccio). Both incomplete: Red Giant version misses the final five songs, Biccio59 cuts during "Twist & Shout". The Biccio59 tape has been pressed on vinyl as part of a limited edition (400) five-LP/three-cd/DVD box set 'A Firenze' from Virgin Vinyl Records.

Held at the home of Manchester City FC. The second show in England and a 30-song set clocking in at three hours 17 minutes. No tour premieres just as the previous night, however "Prove It All Night" (by sign request) has the 1978 intro and "The Promise" is played solo at the piano. Bruce and Steve sing the duet of Marvin Gaye's "It Takes Two" at the end of Two Hearts. During "You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)" Bruce and Steve were joking: Bruce: "You can look between channels 92 and 100 in the hotel." Steve: "Did you look?" Bruce: "Oh no, I looked, but I didn't touch!" It also featured the "Hey you! Get out the car!" line from the original version on the unreleased The Ties That Bind album. Other notable inclusions in the set are "Save My Love", "Cadillac Ranch", the 350th performance of "Land Of Hope And Dreams" and "Twist And Shout", containing a few bars of Chuck Berry's "Louie Louie", to close. Bruce did a striptease (down to a shirt!) during "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out" while standing on the piano. Trumpeter Curt Ramm takes a tumble during "Twist And Shout", much to Bruce and Steve's amusement. Bruce: "I've never seen that happen before!" - and at the end - "We can't do no more, somebody's gonna get hurt!" First ever performances in England of "Save My Love" and "The Promise", as well as the 1978 intro to "Prove It All Night". Patti Scialfa is not present.

Springsteen and band perform at the famous Isle of Wight Festival, hosted on the island off the south coast of England. The third and final show in England in June is a shorter 25-song festival set. Once again no tour premieres, although "Lonesome Day" makes a rare mid-set appearance. According to the setlist "Prove It All Night" including the 1978 introduction was planned, but "Because The Night" is played instead. At the end of "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out", Bruce tells the crowd that he had heard there would be fireworks, and that they would not leave the stage before seeing them, and so "Twist And Shout" closes out the show with the accompaniment of a spectacular fireworks display. Referring to his tumble down the steps in Manchester, Curt Ramm is introduced as "Curt Ramm and his flying trumpet!" This time he takes extra care making his way down the steps. Patti Scialfa is not present.

No audio as yet. Four songs are broadcast by UK satellite channel Sky Arts - "Wrecking Ball", "Death To My Hometown", "Shackled And Drawn" and "Twist And Shout".

The first of two nights at Bercy and the twelfth time Springsteen has played the arena. Back to the stage after a ten-day break and Bruce plays no less than three July 4 specials - "4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)" (with the original "waitress" lyrics), "Darlington County" and a solo piano "Independence Day". In addition "American Land" closes the show. "La Vie en rose" (best known as the signature song of Edith Piaf) welcomes the band on stage, played by the accordion duo of Roy and Charlie. Patti returns to the stage for the first time since Los Angeles - as a result "Easy Money" makes its European debut, replacing "Shackled And Drawn", and "My City Of Ruins" includes "People Get Ready", as well as a snippet of "Sad Mood". Bruce reverts to singing "get on board" rather than "thank the Lord" at the end of "Land Of Hope And Dreams", as will be the case for the remainder of the tour. First ever performances in France of "The E Street Shuffle", "4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)", and "We Are Alive".

Audience tapes (by jeffou67, Le Viben and Zimmy21). Available on CD 'La Vie En Rose' from Godfather. Pro-shot video of "Independence Day" is subsequently posted on Bruce's Youtube channel.

A spectacular 31-song setlist for the second night in Paris with Bruce taking the concept of a varied set on night two and blowing it out of the water. A six-pack of classics (including the second "Something In The Night" of the tour) kick-off the show before we even get to the the usual opener "We Take Care Of Our Own". This wasn't the plan - the setlist shows "The Ties That Bind" going straight into "We Take Care Of Our Own". Both "Incident On 57th Street" and an 11-minute "Racing In The Street" with an extended coda are played - the last time that both songs were played at an E Street show was back in 1978. Also in the set: "I'm Goin' Down", "Easy Money" and the tour premiere of "For You", played solo on the piano. Bruce drags daughter Jessica on stage for a dance during "Dancing In The Dark", and the walk-on music is "Au clair de la lune", played by the accordion duo of Roy and Charlie. "My City Of Ruins" includes "People Get Ready" and a snippet of "Sad Mood". First ever performances in France of "Something In The Night" and "Incident On 57th Street".

Audience tapes (by Camille, D.M, Germain, Le Viben and Zimmy21). Available on CDs 'Au Clair De La Lune' from Godfather and excellent IEM/audience mix 'Paris Second Wrecking Ball Night' (Crystal Cat).

2012-07-14 - HYDE PARK, LONDON, ENGLAND

THUNDER ROAD / BADLANDS / WE TAKE CARE OF OUR OWN / WRECKING BALL / DEATH TO MY HOMETOWN (with Tom Morello) / MY CITY OF RUINS / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / THE PROMISED LAND (with John Fogerty) / TAKE 'EM AS THEY COME / JACK OF ALL TRADES (with Tom Morello) / EMPTY SKY / BECAUSE THE NIGHT / JOHNNY 99 / DARLINGTON COUNTY / WORKING ON THE HIGHWAY / SHACKLED AND DRAWN / WAITIN' ON A SUNNY DAY / RAISE YOUR HAND / THE RIVER / THE GHOST OF TOM JOAD (with Tom Morello) / THE RISING (with Tom Morello) / LAND OF HOPE AND DREAMS - PEOPLE GET READY (with Tom Morello) / WE ARE ALIVE / BORN IN THE U.S.A. / BORN TO RUN / GLORY DAYS / DANCING IN THE DARK / I SAW HER STANDING THERE (with Paul McCartney) / TWIST AND SHOUT - LA BAMBA (with Paul McCartney and Tom Morello) - GOODNIGHT IRENE

Bruce and band return to the Hard Rock Calling Festival in Hyde Park with a fine show and a farcical conclusion. The positives first - an exquisite "Thunder Road" opens, sung with just the accompaniment of Roy Bittan on piano. This same arrangement was regularly heard on the Born To Run Tour, with Bruce specifically noting this was the first thing he played at his first show in London (at the Hammersmith Odeon in November 1975). A sign requested "Take 'Em As They Come" premieres, last played 2003 in Copenhagen. Tom Morello guests on several numbers, including "Death To My Hometown" and "The Ghost Of Tom Joad", and John Fogerty joins for "The Promised Land".

The final guest for the evening is Paul McCartney, and together they play "I Saw Her Standing There" followed by a raucous "Twist and Shout". Unfortunately, despite only being a few minutes over the 10.30pm curfew the concert organisers choose to cut the sound at the conclusion of "Twist And Shout", and as a result Bruce is unable to play a final song, nor is he able to say his farewells to the crowd. Instead he sings a brief a cappella, unamplified "Goodnight Irene" and leaves the stage. As a result, this is the first show of the tour to not include "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out." Steve took to Twitter following the show to express his disappointment and anger, while Bruce commented "I wasn't aware the plug had been pulled, and people couldn't hear what I was singing. Afterwards I said to Paul, 'I can understand them pulling the plug on me, but you? Aren't you a knight?'". Paul McCartney remembers: "Bruce, sort of, got in touch and said, 'Do you wanna get up? We'd like you to get up'. I said, 'Well, I don't know, I'll just come along to the show', so we're in the side of the show in the wings, and he says 'Are you gonna get up, man?', I said 'I don't know, maybe'. Then his roadie says 'I've got a bass for you, I've got a guitar, it's all tuned, it's ready to go'. I go 'Oh, you're REALLY ready!'. So they're all really ready to go, so, what have they rehearsed? He said 'Twist And Shout' and 'I Saw Her Standing There'. So at last minute, I sort of have to say, 'Yeah, I'll do it', so I go on, and it's great, they really have rehearsed it, and I'm the only one who sort of doesn't know it, even though I wrote the bloody thing. So then they go to 'Twist And Shout', and I'm singing it, and someone had whispered 'We haven't got any time, we can't do it', but it was so nice, Bruce is going 'Yeah, come on, man' and Bruce is you know, he's a do-er, a go-getter, so I was happy. 'Yeah!'. We're rocking away, all our monitors stayed on, so we weren't really aware that the plug had been pulled on the audience, that you see on the youtube later, it's all gone dead. And he is singing, he's gonna then go back and sing ' Good Night Irene', which I think was all dead, but we had a laugh again. You've gotta have a laugh, it would just be so terrifying if you didn't, so we just had a laugh afterwards, I was just apologetic like 'I'm sorry, man, only in Britain!'. It's the only place... You can't imagine in New York somewhere like that, them pulling the plug, and it got everyone of course, so that was the big story. Everyone in America was going to me 'Is it true, man? They pulled the plug on you and Springsteen?!', and I'm saying 'Yeah, well, you know, just some guy. Some bloody jobsworth...'"

"My City Of Ruins" includes a snippet of "Sad Mood". Bruce revises the introduction to "Shackled And Drawn" - "hey, hey, I'm calling / working while the rain is falling." European debut of "I Saw Her Standing There" and first ever performance in England of "Take 'Em As They Come". Patti Scialfa is not present.

Audience tape (by Quick45), IEM, audience shot DVD and partial pro-shot video. Excellent IEM mix released on CD 'London Killing The Power Night' from Crystal Cat. Six songs are broadcast on Sky Arts (in the UK) and Palladia (in the US) several months later; "Thunder Road", "Because The Night", "Shackled And Drawn", "We Are Alive", "I Saw Her Standing There" and "Twist And Shout". Audio from the broadcast of these six songs is available on CD 'Twist And Shush' from Godfather.

Opening night in Dublin starts hilariously. Bruce (aided by Steve) drags a giant electrical switch to the front of the stage, turns it to "ON" and says, "Before we were so rudely interrupted..!" (referring to the previous show in London) and play the last minute or so of "Twist And Shout" followed by the night's first tour premiere, "I Fought The Law". The second, "I'm A Rocker" is played by request. "My Hometown", the third, is dedicated to U2. During "Dancing in the Dark" the big screens show the giant switch, in the "ON" position. Two people, dressed as a London police officer and a City official come on stage to stop them playing "Twist And Shout", but Bruce refuses. Before playing "American Land" the characters return, wrestling Bruce and Steve for control of the switch as it is turned on and off before finally going back to "ON." Patti Scialfa returns to the stage for the first time since the two shows in Paris - consequently, "Easy Money" returns to the set and "My City Of Ruins" includes "People Get Ready". First ever performances in Ireland of "I Fought The Law", "We Take Care Of Our Own", "Wrecking Ball", "Death To My Hometown", "I'm A Rocker", "Jack Of All Trades", "Easy Money", and "We Are Alive".

Jake Clemons arrives on stage in a wheelchair. According to Bruce, "Jake sneezed last night and put his back out" - consequently he sings during "Spirit In The Night", "crazy Jakey got really hurt / He sneezed, threw out his back in just his socks and shirt". Second show in Dublin with no less than sixteen songs not played the previous night. A solo acoustic "This Hard Land" opens, the second airing for the song this tour, although the first in this arrangement. A Darkness On The Edge Of Town trio follows "We Take Care Of Our Own", and it's not until the ninth song of the evening that we get to "Wrecking Ball". "My City Of Ruins" includes "People Get Ready". Other notables include the third tour performance of "Jackson Cage" and magnificent triple hit of a solo piano "The Promise", "The River" and "Backstreets" before "Land Of Hope And Dreams" closes the main set. Encores include an unexpected "Rocky Ground" before the obligatory "American Land" for Ireland brings the evening to a close. First ever performances in Ireland of "Something In The Night", "Jackson Cage", "The Promise", "Backstreets", and "Rocky Ground".

I want to send this out as a prayer for a peaceful future for Norway and dedicate it to the families that lost their loved ones."

Stunning setlist for the second night in Gothenburg, the highlight of which is clearly the return of "Jungleland", the first time it has been played since the death of Clarence Clemons in June 2011. Unsurprisingly it was dedicated to The Big Man. If that's not enough there's also the tour debuts of "Lost In The Flood" (by request), the European debut of "Frankie", and "Where The Bands Are". The full-band "Frankie" was last played September 2003, in Boston. The last time "Lost In The Flood", "Backstreets" and "Jungleland" were all played in the same set was back in September 1978, at the Masonic Temple Theatre in Detroit, MI. The wet show opens with "Who'll Stop The Rain", and the 31-song set also includes "Downbound Train", "I'm Goin' Down" and an outstanding "It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City", played by request. Bruce said it was the song that got him his record deal, back in May 1972. Patti Scialfa is not present. Prior to the show Steve tweeted, "There's something about the thought of fans waiting out in the rain all day that makes us crazy. I feel one for the ages coming on." He was right!

Audience tapes (incomplete, 'Wrecking Gothenburg (Night #2)' by LB and a complete tape by Mortenkofed). Released on CD 'Gothenburg Second Wrecking Ball Night' from Crystal Cat, which appears to be an IEM/audience mix.

Just how could Bruce follow up two wonderful nights in Gothenburg? With the longest show in his performing history, of course. 33 songs over four hours 6 minutes, and that doesn't include the five song acoustic pre-set played to the fans that made it into the stadium early, just thank them for following him around Europe. Following the mini-set he spent ten minutes collecting signs and shaking hands before returning to the microphone to say, “Thanks to all you regulars and thanks for making it a lovely summer for us, and we'll see you in a little while!” The main set opens with CCR's "Rockin' All Over The World", last played in 2009 at the final show of the Working On A Dream Tour in Buffalo. "Prove It All Night" with the 1978 introduction follows soon after. Also played, the second "Light Of Day" of the tour, plus the Wrecking Ball Tour debut of "Back In Your Arms". The nine-song encore includes three premieres, "Detroit Medley", "I Don't Want To Go Home" (last played at an E Street Band show in 1981), and "(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher And Higher". "Twist And Shout" brings the night, and the European leg of the tour, to a conclusion. European debuts of "I Don't Want To Go Home" and "(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher And Higher", and first ever performances in Finland of "Leap Of Faith", "For You", "Blinded By The Light", "Rockin' All Over The World", "Loose Ends", "We Take Care Of Our Own", "Wrecking Ball", "Death To My Hometown", "Does This Bus Stop At 82nd Street?", "Be True", "Jack Of All Trades", "Downbound Train", "Light Of Day", "Shackled And Drawn", "Back In Your Arms", "We Are Alive", and the "Detroit Medley".. What a night, what a tour. Patti Scialfa is not present and Jon Landau played guitar on "(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher And Higher" and "Twist And Shout".

Audience tapes by Corenol (inc. pre-set), Queengrooves and Tootai. The Tootai tape is released as 'The Finnish Finish' (Ev2), which also includes the acoustic pre-set from Corenol's recording. However, the Queengrooves tape is probably the best of the three.

"Thunder Road" opens, performed by Springsteen accompanied only by Roy. A quartet of summer songs follows, including the second "Summertime Blues" of the tour. Eddie Floyd's "Knock On Wood" makes a surprise appearance, only previously played with the E Street Band on April 29, 1976. "Thundercrack", "Frankie" and "Prove It All Night" (with 1978 intro, for the first time in the United States since 1980) follow. If that's not enough, "Backstreets" includes a 'Dream Baby Dream' interlude. A solo acoustic "Who'll Stop The Rain" opens an encore set that also features "Detroit Medley", "Quarter To Three" (with "I'm a prisoner of rock 'n' roll!") and "American Land" with Ken Casey from Dropkick Murphys. Patti Scialfa is not present.

Last show in Philly this tour opens with the tour premiere "Factory" in a solo acoustic performance on Labor Day, the first of five songs in a row from Darkness On The Edge Of Town before "We Take Care Of Our Own". A stunning guitar-laden trio after "Factory" includes "Prove It All Night", with the 1978 guitar introduction. The Darkness-heavy opening was intended, although "Streets Of Fire" was audibled in. There's also three songs in a row from Greetings, along with another airing for "Frankie". "The River" is played by request (although it was also on the printed setlist), and "Jungleland" is the highlight of the encores, with "American Land" closing the show. Second concert of the tour (after the first night in Barcelona) to only feature Springsteen originals and no cover songs. The printed setlist shows several tantalising possibilities that Bruce elected to skip, including "Incident On 57th Street", "Ain't Good Enough For You", "My Love Will Not Let You Down", "Light Of Day", "Love Train" (The O'Jays, never played by Springsteen), and "(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher And Higher". Patti Scialfa is not present.

Just like the night before, Gary U.S. Bonds joins the band for "Jole Blon" and "This Little Girl". A full band tour premiere is for "Janey, Don't You Lose Heart". "My City Of Ruins includes "Twistin' The Night Away". At midnight the crowd sang "Happy Birthday" to Bruce and prior to "Twist And Shout" Bruce cut a cake (delivered by Bruce's mom Adele, his oldest sister Ginny, Patti Scialfa's mother - introducing whom Bruce sings a line from Allen Toussaint's "Mother-In-Law" - and brother, plus Maureen Van Zandt) for his 63rd birthday, and shared it with fans in the pit, who once again sang "Happy Birthday".

"Prove It All Night" does not include the introduction but features an ending solo by Nils Lofgren. Nebraska songs "Johnny 99" and "Reason To Believe" are played back-to-back by sign request. For the first time of the tour, Bruce plays the same album, Born In The U.S.A., in sequence for two nights in a row. Bruce is joined on stage by his mother Adele and sister Pamela, who plays guitar during "Dancing In The Dark". Zac Brown joins on guitar and backing vocals for "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out". Surprisingly, Bruce skips his planned "Thunder Road" and instead, responding to a tattoo of a fan down front, ends the set with an acoustic version of "My Lucky Day". First ever performance in England of "I'm Goin' Down". Patti Scialfa is not present.

Audience tape (BluesMick). Five songs ("Prove It All Night", "Johnny 99", "Reason To Believe", "Jungleland" and "My Lucky Day") available as bonus tracks on Godfather's CD 'Lucille' from the previous night in Saint-Denis. Five songs are later broadcast by MTV: "Atlantic City", "Cover Me", "I'm On Fire", "I'm Goin' Down" and "The Rising". A DVD of the complete Born In The U.S.A. performance is officially issued with the Deluxe Edition of the High Hopes album, available on a limited basis via Amazon and other retailers.

29-song set for the first of four shows in South America. Bruce's first ever performance in Chile. The setlist looks very much like the 2012 shows with the return of "My City Of Ruins" (including a line of "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out") and "The E Street Shuffle" and no unexpected rarities. Bruce begins the encores with a cover of Victor Jara's "Manifiesto", sung entirely in Spanish. Jara was a teacher, poet, singer-songwriter, political activist and member of the Communist Party Of Chile. Soon after the Chilean Coup of September 1973 he was arrested, tortured and murdered. The song is performed in a sparse acoustic arrangement, with Springsteen accompanied by Nils Lofgren and Curt Ramm. Pro-shot video of "Manifiesto" was subsequently posted online. Finding himself lost while roaming the arena during "Spirit In The Night", Bruce has to stop the song so he can locate and return to the stage before resuming. Set closes with a solo acoustic "This Hard Land". Patti Scialfa is not present.

"No Surrender" and "Bobby Jean" are also requests. A fan proposes to his girlfriend onstage during "She's The One". Show once again finishes with the solo acoustic "This Hard Land". Bruce's second-ever performance in Brazil; only "The River", "Born In The U.S.A.", "Born To Run", and "Dancing In The Dark" had been played in the country previously. Patti Scialfa is not present.

Opening night of the High Hopes Tour and Springsteen's first show in South Africa. The Specials' "Free Nelson Mandela" opens the 27-song set, but otherwise the show bears a strong resemblance to a Wrecking Ball Tour setlist. Only four songs from High Hopes, including "American Skin (41 Shots)" and "The Ghost Of Tom Joad", the latter with Tom Morello sharing lead vocals, make the show. "We Are Alive" is dedicated to Nelson Mandela and features rewritten lyrics with references to South African history, and the set closes with an acoustic "Thunder Road". Click on the date/location link above to view video of "Free Nelson Mandela" as well as photographs and other media. Soundcheck is open to the media, including a Q&A session with Springsteen. Patti Scialfa is not present.

Official concert recording was available for purchase and download via Live Nation until June 30, 2014. The recording is now available to purchase in multiple formats, including CD and high definition audio, from Springsteen's official live download site at live.brucespringsteen.net. This was the first show released officially in the live download series. Show-goers were able to purchase a USB wristband online or at the show and download the audio, when made available a few days after the show, or could opt to purchase the audio alone in either MP3 or lossless FLAC formats.

"We Shall Overcome" is dedicated to Pete Seeger, who died on January 27 at the age of 94. "Two Hearts" includes "It Takes Two". Patti Scialfa is not present.

Seemingly not content with night two's fourteen premieres, Springsteen debuts sixteen songs, all in their first-ever South African performances, including the world premiere of "This Is Your Sword" and the first performance of Little Steven's "Sun City" on tour, with guest. Mos Def. In total, Bruce played 57 different songs over the three nights in Cape Town. Other notable tracks in the 30-song set include "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" in slot three, a nice Darkness On The Edge Of Town double-shot of "Adam Raised A Cain" and "Something In The Night", as well as "Tougher Than The Rest". Tom Morello's brother proposes to his fiancée on stage - fortunately she says yes. Set also includes the 400th performance of "Waitin' On A Sunny Day". Patti Scialfa is not present.

2014-02-01 - FNB STADIUM, JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA

Pre-show (solo acoustic): WORKING ON THE HIGHWAY / I'LL WORK FOR YOUR LOVE / GROWIN' UP

FREE NELSON MANDELA / LAND OF HOPE AND DREAMS - PEOPLE GET READY / NO SURRENDER / SEEDS / OUT IN THE STREET / CADILLAC RANCH / HIGH HOPES / WRECKING BALL / DEATH TO MY HOMETOWN / HUNGRY HEART / I'M ON FIRE / THE RIVER / AMERICAN SKIN (41 SHOTS) / HEAVEN'S WALL / MURDER INCORPORATED / JOHNNY 99 / WORKING ON THE HIGHWAY / DARLINGTON COUNTY / SHACKLED AND DRAWN / WAITIN' ON A SUNNY DAY / THE RISING / THE GHOST OF TOM JOAD / BADLANDS / WHO'LL STOP THE RAIN / BORN IN THE U.S.A. / BORN TO RUN / BOBBY JEAN / DANCING IN THE DARK / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT / SHOUT / THUNDER ROAD

Springsteen's final show in South Africa is a 31-song performance, lasting three hours and twenty minutes. Bruce appears on stage while the stadium is filling to entertain the early-birds with a three-song solo acoustic set that includes "I'll Work For Your Love". Pro-shot video of that song and "Growin' Up" is subsequently posted on Springsteen's Youtube channel. Some three-and-a-half hours later the main set opens with "Free Nelson Mandela" and is followed by "Land Of Hope And Dreams", hardly surprising considering the close links the FNB Stadium has with Mandela. Five tour premieres make their South African debuts (plus two more in the pre-set), including "Cadillac Ranch" and by request, "I'm On Fire". Bruce's microphone fails at the start of "The Ghost Of Tom Joad", resulting in a nice two-minute guitar improvisation before he continues the song. Rain falls during the show, prompting the encore opener, "Who'll Stop The Rain". Show closes with a solo acoustic "Thunder Road". Patti Scialfa is not present.

Official concert recording was available for purchase and download via Live Nation until June 30, 2014.

Prior to the show the soundcheck is open to the media, and Springsteen hosted a Q&A session. Soundcheck includes a full-band "Dream Baby Dream", an arrangement which will not be seen in a show. Springsteen's first-ever performance in Perth is a 27-song, three hour set opening with the tour premiere of "Frankie Fell In Love" and also includes "The E Street Shuffle" and a sixteen-minute "Kitty's Back". Bruce slips a few lyrics from "Oh, Pretty Woman" into the latter. A solo piano performance of "For You" is another highlight, played by request. "She's The One" includes "Not Fade Away" in the introduction, and the tour premiere of "Ramrod" kicks off the encores. Following "The River", Everett Bradley plays the intro to "Heaven's Wall" instead of "American Skin (41 Shots)", so Bruce changes his mind and goes with "Heaven's Wall". Springsteen forgets the lyrics to "Darlington County". Show-closing "Thunder Road" is solo-acoustic. First ever performances in Australia of "Frankie Fell In Love", "Kitty's Back", "Heaven's Wall", "American Skin (41 Shots)", "For You", and "Shout". Patti Scialfa is not present.

Official concert recording was available for purchase and download via Live Nation until June 30, 2014.

Six tour premieres in total include a solo acoustic "Girls In Their Summer Clothes" (another sign request), "Save My Love" and "Youngstown". "Two Hearts" includes "It Takes Two" and "Light Of Day" includes "Land Of 1000 Dances". "Heaven's Wall" moves to the encore opening slot.

No less that eight premieres tonight, which makes a total of 56 different songs played over three nights in Perth. Biggest surprise of the tour so far is the premiere and first ever Springsteen performance of AC/DC's "Highway To Hell", which is followed by a Darkness On The Edge Of Town four-pack which includes the tour debuts of "Streets Of Fire" and "Candy's Room". Almost as surprising as the opener is what misses out - no "Waitin' On A Sunny Day". As a result this is the first E Street show since 2000 to feature no songs from The Rising album. Three more premieres in the encores include a solo piano "The Promise" and a solo acoustic "Terry's Song", only the third time it has been played in concert. First ever performances in Australia of "Highway To Hell", "Streets Of Fire", "The Promise", and "Terry's Song". "Hunter Of Invisible Game" is setlisted, but not played. Patti Scialfa is not present.

Also Sydney is treated to a full album performance of Darkness On The Edge Of Town, which includes the tour premiere of "Racing In The Street". The encores starts with INXS' "Don't Change", and closes with two more tour debuts: "Surprise, Surprise" and a solo harmonium "Dream Baby Dream". "Born To Run" is performed at high speed, following the song Bruce said that it was "the fastest we've ever played that motherfucker". First ever Springsteen performances for "Friday On My Mind" and "Don't Change", and the first ever performances in Australia of "Surprise, Surprise" and "Dream Baby Dream". Both Jake Clemons (due to the death of his father) and Patti Scialfa are not present.

Springsteen performs at the Hope Estate Winery in Hunter Valley, a region of New South Wales. Dan Sultan opens for Bruce & Band. 26-song, three hour set opens with a cover of Stick McGhee's "Drinkin' Wine, Spo-Dee-O-Dee", an appropriate choice given the venue. The song has been covered by various artists, including Jerry Lee Lewis and Mike Bloomfield's Electric Flag, as "Wine", but this is the first ever Springsteen performance. No other great surprises in the main-set, which is typical for a festival type appearance. The encores open with a solo acoustic "The Wish", last played in 2005 during the Devils & Dust Tour, and only for the sixth time since the end of the Solo Acoustic Tour in 1997. "The Wish" is also the 114th song to be played on the High Hopes Tour. Unusually, "Badlands" does not include the false ending. "Two Hearts" includes "It Takes Two". "Murder Incorporated" is played by sign request. "Friday On My Mind" returns, and the set closes with "Thunder Road", this time performed full-band. Patti Scialfa is not present, Jake Clemons returns to the horn section after missing the previous show in Sydney.

Last show in Australia and Bruce pulls out all the stops with a thirty-song, three-hour-43-minute set. Three tour premieres open the show starting with the first ever Springsteen rendition of the Bee Gees' "Stayin' Alive". The Gibbs emigrated to Australia and settled near Brisbane in the late 1950s. "It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City", "Does This Bus Stop At 82nd Street?" and Growin' Up, including an intro story about growing up and superheroes, follow, all audibled. Following thereafter are sign request performances of "You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)", "Sherry Darling", "Save My Love", and only the 26th performance of "Fade Away", played "for Steve". Bruce allowed the crowd to decide how to continue, more signs or something special. They selected the latter, and it was indeed something special - a complete performance of The Wild, The Innocent & The E Street Shuffle for only the second time. The Cooper + Koo string section (Sally Cooper, Yena Choi, Francesca Hiew, Natalysaa Bing, Caity Lacy, Susanna Sus, Nadia Buck and Airlie Koo) join the band for "Stayin' Alive" and "New York City Serenade". By comparison the rest of the set is standard fare, apart from Eddie Vedder guesting on "Highway To Hell". The acoustic "Thunder Road" brings Springsteen's Australian Tour to a conclusion. First ever performances in Australia for "Stayin' Alive", "It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City", "You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)", "Fade Away", "Wild Billy's Circus Story", and "New York City Serenade". Over the fifteen shows in South Africa and Australia Bruce and the band played a total of 126 songs. Patti Scialfa is not present.

HUNTER OF INVISIBLE GAME

Film shoot for portions of the Hunter Of Invisible Game short-film, released to Springsteen's website on July 9, 2014.

I STILL HAVEN'T FOUND WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR / STAND BY ME

Bruce makes a surprise appearance at the final night of U2's eight night stand at Madison Square Garden. After Bono hinted at what was to come by singing a few lines of "Hungry Heart" at the end of "Beautiful Day", he spoke about Springsteen's profound influence on the band before introducing Bruce, who played guitar and shared vocals on "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" after letting the crowd sing the opening verse. They then transitioned into an impromptu "Stand By Me", a song they also played in 1987 at Philadelphia's JFK Stadium, the first time Bruce and U2 shared a stage.

2015-12-09 - SIRIUSXM RADIO, NEW YORK CITY, NY

Bruce calls into SiriusXM's E Street Radio to chat about the upcoming River Tour and reveals he has been working on a solo album in addition to the recently released The Ties That Bind: The River Collection box set. "The project I've been working on is more of a solo project," he said. "It wasn't a project I was going to probably take the band out on. So I said, 'Gee, that's going to push the band playing again until a ways in the future. It'll be nice to get some playing in so you don't wind up being two or three years between E Street tours.' This will give us a chance to get out there and stretch our muscles a little bit." The River Tour begins in Pittsburgh on January 16, and according to Bruce, was booked at the last minute. "We made the box set and there was no plan to tour," he said. "Then we felt, 'Maybe we should do a show just to raise the flag and have some fun and make it a little more exciting.' I said. 'Okay, maybe we'll do a show in New York.' Then that went quick to, 'Maybe we should do a couple of shows.' Then it turns into, 'Maybe we should do a small series of shows, basically one-nighters, with maybe a little bit around the country."

The 33-song set includes the tour premiere of "Loose Ends". Normally Bruce counts twice 1-2-3-4 before "Jackson Cage", but this time he started the song after the first count. The band did not follow, so they started over. After the crowd-surf during "Hungry Heart", Jake had trouble lifting Bruce back on stage. "I'm going down!" was Bruce's cry when he almost touched the floor, but while playing the sax, Jake managed to lift Bruce back on stage. Instead of letting Nils, Jake and Soozie sing their lines on "Out In The Street", Bruce called for Garry after Steve. Gary did not expect this and was too late with his line. Patti Scialfa is not present.

With 33 songs and just short of three-and-a-half hours, the sole Philadelphia date of the tour is the longest show to date. Two tour premieres feature in the set, "My Love Will Not Let You Down" with Bruce climbing on the amps in front of the drum riser to encourage Max during his solo, and a memorable and emotional "Jungleland". Bruce adds a new introduction to "Drive All Night", explaining that late in the River sessions he needed a love song so he went back into the archives to find the song, which was originally recorded in 1977 during the Darkness On The Edge Of Town sessions. Bruce then added a new vocal to the original 1977 backing track. Patti Scialfa returns to the stage after missing the last two shows.

A 33-song set with no surprises. Before "I Wanna Marry You", Bruce assisted with an actual marriage proposal way up in Section 334. Giving a shake of his maracas and a shout out of encouragement to the young man as he proposed to his bride-to-be. A little extra money was earned from his "Dancing in the Dark" partner, as Bruce accepted a 20-dollar bill which was pinned to her unique sign in return for a dance.

Once again no big surprises in the 34-song setlist. Before “Born to Run”, Bruce took a moment to recognize the late Alex Cooley, the legendary Atlanta concert promoter, who passed away this past December. Alex Cooley was an integral part of Springsteen's early career. Springsteen and the E Street Band played three shows at Cooley's Electric Ballroom in August 1975. The Atlanta shows in 1976, 1977 and 1978 were also promoted by Cooley. Bruce dedicated “Born to Run” in his honor.

2016-04-10 - GREENSBORO COLISEUM, GREENSBORO, NC

Show cancelled on April 8, 2016. The same day, Bruce released the following statement on his website:

"As you, my fans, know I'm scheduled to play in Greensboro, North Carolina this Sunday. As we also know, North Carolina has just passed HB2, which the media are referring to as the "bathroom" law. HB2—known officially as the Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act—dictates which bathrooms transgender people are permitted to use. Just as important, the law also attacks the rights of LGBT citizens to sue when their human rights are violated in the workplace. No other group of North Carolinians faces such a burden. To my mind, it's an attempt by people who cannot stand the progress our country has made in recognizing the human rights of all of our citizens to overturn that progress. Right now, there are many groups, businesses, and individuals in North Carolina working to oppose and overcome these negative developments. Taking all of this into account, I feel that this is a time for me and the band to show solidarity for those freedom fighters. As a result, and with deepest apologies to our dedicated fans in Greensboro, we have canceled our show scheduled for Sunday, April 10th. Some things are more important than a rock show and this fight against prejudice and bigotry—which is happening as I write—is one of them. It is the strongest means I have for raising my voice in opposition to those who continue to push us backwards instead of forwards."

The first of two nights in Brooklyn, bringing the U.S. leg of The River Tour to an end. While the stage was bathed in purple light Bruce and Band (wearing purple clothing or accessories) pay tribute to Prince, who died April 21, by playing his classic hit-song "Purple Rain" as the show-opener. The first time this tour a song other than "Meet Me In The City" has opened, and Bruce also dropped the usual greetings and vamp section, instead speaking first at the conclusion of the song. "Tonight we want to dedicate our show to Prince of course", he said. "There's never been any better bandleader, showman, songwriter, arranger. Whenever I would catch one of his shows I would always leave humbled. I'm going to miss that and we're going to miss that." Later in the show Bruce also announced that "these will be the last two nights we will officially play The River from start to finish", suggesting that the European tour will see a change in the setlists. When asked later if The River would be played in Europe, Garry Tallent tweeted "not in toto and not in sequence". Patti Scialfa is not present.

Official concert recording available for purchase in multiple formats, including CD and high definition audio, from Springsteen's official live download site at live.brucespringsteen.net. Since April 25 "Purple Rain" is available for download in MP3 format from Springsteen's official live download site at live.brucespringsteen.net . A Pro-shot video of "Purple Rain" was added to Youtube soon after, but removed a couple of days later.

Final night of the U.S. leg of The River Tour. The 35-song (36 if you include "Blinded By The Light") set features two tour premieres as Bruce begins collecting sign-requests again. The post-River section starts with "Boom Boom", followed soon after by "Trapped". Sandwiching the two is the second "Loose Ends" of the tour, as well as a partial "Blinded By The Light", after Bruce read a sign that said "I’ve been Blinded by the Light! (I’m 10 years old and I know all the words.Try me!)" The 10-year-old girl sung the lead vocal for the first two verses, accompanied by Springsteen strumming his guitar and gentle backing from the band. For now, we are including "Blinded By The Light" in the setlist, but not counting it as a tour premiere or in Brucebase's statistics. Once again Bruce and the Band pay tribute to Prince, with "Purple Rain" opening the encores. Springsteen spoke again about the full album performance, saying "Tonight this is going to be our last official performance of The River from start to finish.... We're gonna open up our setlists over in Europe. So let's go down to the river one more time and see what we find." Patti Scialfa is not present.

Bruce makes his third appearance at the Rock in Rio Lisboa Festival. Stereophonics and Portuguese rock band Xutos & Pontapés perform on the Palco Mundo (World Stage) before Springsteen. It's a late night for Bruce and the Band, with the show starting a few minutes before midnight and finishing just after 2:30am. The 27-song festival-style set is heavy on the Born In The U.S.A. material with nine of the twelve songs on the album played, including the tour premieres of "Downbound Train" and "I'm On Fire". As a result the set features only three songs from The River, and "The Ties That Bind", "Sherry Darling", "Two Hearts", "I Wanna Marry You", "Point Blank", "Ramrod", and "Drive All Night" are all dropped for the first time this tour. Three other tour premieres; "Darkness On The Edge Of Town", "Johnny 99", and "Spirit In The Night". The set closes with the acoustic "This Hard Land".

First of three shows at Gothenburg's Ullevi. The 38-song set ties the record for most songs in one show and clocks in at just under four hours (about 3:58), the second-longest of Springsteen's career (behind only Helsinki 2012, which was 4:06). Set opens with the first of three tour premieres, "The Promise", played alone on the piano. Main-set also includes the second "My Lucky Day" of the tour and "Save My Love" by request, as well as "Tunnel Of Love" and "Shackled And Drawn", both of which were soundchecked several times over the previous few shows. The former may have been inspired by Nils Lofgren, who replied "Tunnel Of Love" when recently asked on Twitter what song he would like Bruce to set list. It was last played August 2, 2008 in Foxborough, MA. Set closer is the solo acoustic "Thunder Road". First ever performances in Sweden for "Save My Love", "American Skin (41 Shots)", and "Shout".

First of two concerts at the arena previously known as the Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy, where Springsteen played thirteen shows between 1981 and 2012. Set opens with a solo piano "Incident On 57th Street" before the tour premiere of "Reason To Believe", the bullet microphone arrangement first seen on the Magic Tour. The set features fifteen songs from The River, the most ever to date at a show in Europe. Tour premieres also of "Into The Fire" and a solo acoustic "Nebraska". The former was last played September 22, 2012 at MetLife Stadium, while the latter has only been played one other time at an E Street Band show since 1985. Elliott Murphy and his son Gaspard joined Bruce on stage for "Born To Run" on guitar and backing vocals. The PA system and lighting failed during "Ramrod", so the band finished the song unamplified after taking a lap around the pit. While waiting for the power to return Bruce sat on the stage autographing signs while the crowd clapped and sang, and wrote a sign of his own saying "5 min break". The power returned shortly after, and "Ramrod" was resumed and completed: "Stevie! what time is it?, is it quittin' time?, is it fuse blowing time?, then what time is it!!?" The show closes with a solo acoustic performance of "Thunder Road". First ever performances in France for "Jackson Cage", "Crush On You", "I'm A Rocker", "Drive All Night", and "Shout".

Official concert recording available for purchase in multiple formats, including CD and high definition audio, from Springsteen's official live download site at live.brucespringsteen.net. Due to the power outage, "Ramrod" is only the first 2:30, and "Dancing In The Dark" is missing the opening seconds. A partial audience tape (by Eddy_Wehbe) and saved Mixlr Stream (by Tosti_Kaas ) are also available (both including the full outage).

Second and last night in Paris opens with the tour premiere of Darkness On The Edge Of Town outtake "Iceman", performed for only the third time. After "Lucky Town" Bruce announces in French a full and in sequence performance of The River for the first time ever in Europe, bringing with it the first performances of "Fade Away", "Stolen Car", and "Wreck On The Highway" of the European leg. Just like at the shows in America, Bruce does some crowd surfing during "Hungry Heart". While performing "I Wanna Marry You" a wedding proposal took place on stage, and Bruce pronounced them, by the powers of 'Rock and Roll' vested in him, husband and wife. Many jokes regarding the blown fuse of the first night in Paris during "Ramrod". In the encores a full band version of "Growin' Up", rolling straight into "Because The Night". The set closes with a solo acoustic "Thunder Road". First ever performance in Europe for "Iceman", along with the first ever performances in France for "I Wanna Marry You", "Fade Away", "Stolen Car" (last played in Europe in May 1981), and "The Price You Pay".

Two other tour debuts in the 34-song set, "Summertime Blues" and a solo acoustic "The Ghost Of Tom Joad", with sign requests "Boom Boom" and "Detroit Medley" making surprise mid-set appearances amongst twelve songs from The River.

A rainy start in Trondheim, so Bruce opens with tour premiere "Who'll Stop The Rain". The second tour premiere, "Radio Nowhere", is the 127th song played on the tour. Nils messes up the lyrics during "Darlington County", much to Bruce's amusement. Sign requests were picked for "Loose Ends" and "Waitin' On A Sunny Day". The show closes with a solo acoustic "Thunder Road". First ever performance in Norway for "Loose Ends". Patti Scialfa is not present.

Don't do it down there, do it it up here." "Love is in the room tonight." The couple came up on stage to the cheers of the crowd. "My City Of Ruins", "Waitin' On A Sunny Day", "Darkness On The Edge Of Town", and the third "Lost In The Flood" of the tour are played by sign request.

The set begins with an incredible run of nine songs written in 1973 or earlier, including the tour premiere of "Kitty's Back". Three other tour debuts pepper the set: "Pretty Flamingo", "Living Proof" (dedicated to Bruce and Patti's oldest child, Evan), and "Secret Garden" (for only the third time at a full concert), all of which were rehearsed at the extensive soundcheck. The printed setlist also included three other songs from the 92/93 period, "Lucky Town", "Human Touch", and "Better Days". The first song from The River does not appear until the 18th song of the night. Rickie Lee Jones is onstage for several songs on percussion and backing vocals but is mostly inaudible throughout.

This interview was due to begin at 4:45pm.

During this session Bruce was probably also interviewed by Kirsty Young for Desert Island Discs, which was broadcast on December 18 on BBC Radio 4. The eight songs that Springsteen chose to take to the island were "Hound Dog" by Elvis Presley, "I Wanna Hold Your Hand" (The Beatles), "It's All Over Now" (The Rolling Stones), "Madame George" (Van Morrison), "What's Going On" (Marvin Gaye), "Out Of Sight" (James Brown), "Like A Rolling Stone" (Bob Dylan, and Bruce's choice for the one record to save from the sea), and the Four Tops' "Baby I Need Your Lovin'". His initial choice for the luxury was a chef, but after being told that no living things were allowed, he settled for a guitar. Bruce's book choice was Joe Klein's Woody Guthrie: A Life.

Bruce said: "I will take you in the Cadillac, four people for two hours from my house to the Jersey Freeze in Freehold N,J, and I will buy you all the hot dogs and hamburgers you will like." Bruce then said, "I'll throw in my Mother's lasagna." The four-song acoustic set includes "Long Walk Home" and "I'll Work For Your Love".

According to reports, Bruce stages a secret acoustic gig of fifteen songs in the White House's East Room to reward Barack Obama's staff for their hard work during the past eight years. Patti joins Bruce for "Tougher Than The Rest" and "If I Should Fall behind". The set also includes a rare performance of "My Father's House", last played October 6, 2005 in Rochester, NY.

“It was a dream of a setlist … Bruce opened with a very brief note of thanks to the president and the staff who were being honoured before launching into Working on the Highway. That opener led into an incredible Growin’ Up for a lively start, but not much of the set was so upbeat, with haunting readings of songs like My Hometown, My Father’s House, and Devils & Dust. The mood in the room the whole night – both reception and concert – was not exactly sombre, but it wasn’t festive, either. It was elegiac, I’d say. There was a clear sense of something ending, both with the conclusion of an adventure for the staff and the silent presence of the coming political transition. Bruce’s demeanour was definitely in line with that overall vibe.”

First show of the 'Summer '17 Tour', a run of fourteen shows in just over a month in Australia and New Zealand. The first of three shows in Perth is a 30-song set kicking off with a string accompanied version of "New York City Serenade" followed by a political speech 48 hours after Donald Trump is inaugurated as President of the United States: "The E Street Band is so glad to be here in Western Australia", said Springsteen. "We are a long way from home, but our hearts and spirits are with the hundreds of thousands of the women and men that marched yesterday in every city of America and in Melbourne. Who rallied against hate and division and in support of tolerance, inclusion, reproductive rights, civil rights, racial justice, LGBTQ rights, the environment, wage equality, gender equality, health care and immigrant rights. We stand with you. We are the new American Resistance." The set structure is very similar to that seen at the final shows of The River Tour, with a suite of songs from Greetings From Asbury Park, NJ and The Wild, The Innocent & The E Street Shuffle early on. "Blood Brothers" makes its first ever appearance outside the U.S. in a solo acoustic arrangement with the original lyrics, performed by sign request. Nils takes over the vocals for a verse of "Darlington County", as he did on the 2016 River Tour. Patti Scialfa is not present.

Official concert recording available for purchase in multiple formats, including CD and high definition audio, from Springsteen's official live download site at live.brucespringsteen.net. Pro-shot video of Bruce's brief speech following "New York City Serenade" is released through the official website and YouTube.

The second show of three in Perth opens again with a string accompanied version of "New York City Serenade", turning into a 26-song set with sixteen songs not played the first night. Bruce drops the suite of "oldies" for a set that perhaps appeals more to the casual fan, with songs such as "Two Hearts", "My City Of Ruins", and "Mary's Place". Patti Scialfa is not present.

After the 28-song show kicks off with a string-accompanied "New York City Serenade", Bruce speaks out on President Trump before playing "American Land". "Tonight we want to add our voices to the thousands of Americans who are protesting, at airports around the country, the Muslim Ban and the detention of foreign nationals and refugees. America is a nation of immigrants and we find this anti-democratic and fundamentally un-American." "Land of Hope and Dreams" has a reference to Muslims and "Trapped" is dedicated to "the detainees", those affected by Trump's order to ban immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. The first ever performance in Australia of "Brown Eyed Girl" is by sign request of some Australians dressed up as characters from TV show The Honeymooners. They are called up the stage to join and even play the piano. The set also includes "Something In The Night" and "Racing In The Street", and a solo acoustic performance of "If I Should Fall Behind" follows "Thunder Road". Richie Sambora joins the band on stage for "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out" and "Shout". All warmed up Bruce starts "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" with the wrong guitar and needs to restart. Patti Scialfa is not present.

He dedicates the song to Malcolm Turnbull, the Australian Prime Minister who had an abrupt end to his phone call with President Trump yesterday. He introduces the song by saying "We stand before you as embarrassed Americans tonight... we're gonna use this to send a letter back home". "New York City Serenade" moves to a slot mid-way through the set, which also includes a solo acoustic "Long Walk Home", and "Twist And Shout", accompanied by a firework display over the stadium. Patti Scialfa is not present. A reunited Jet opens the event.
