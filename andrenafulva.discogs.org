** I will stand by my opinion and I will be right. – no, not my motto; just the funniest thing I've read in the forum recently.

Welcome

Welcome to Discogs! There are some resources to help you learn how things should be done in Discogs, so it's not so
baffling. If you haven't already done so, read the
[url=https://support.discogs.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004051893-Quick-Start-Guide-For-New-Contributors]quick start guide
for new contributors[/ url], which takes about 20 minutes and gives you all the basics in simple form. It's worth
bookmarking the [url=https://support.discogs.com/hc/en-us/sections/360001058453-Full-Submission-Guidelines]full release
submission guidelines[/ url] for reference on specific points. If you get stuck and want help, feel free to post in the
[url=https://www.discogs.com/forum/topic/25]Submission Help forum[/ url]. Good luck!

** Copy to draft

One other thing that you'll find useful: when you're adding a new version of something already in the database, there's
a very handy 'copy to draft' function that can save a lot of time and avoid errors being introduced. Simply find the
version that most closely matches your copy or is most complete, and 'copy to draft'. You'll then need to go through the
draft line by line, checking every piece of data against your copy and changing or removing anything that doesn't match
exactly, but it can still save a lot of work. Read this article on
[url=https://support.discogs.com/hc/en-us/articles/360005007074-How-To-Copy-A-Release-To-Draft]how to copy a release to
draft[/ url] for more information.

** Taking images

The only images that are allowed are photos or scans taken of the physical copy in your possession. It's not allowed to
upload images found on the web or elsewhere. If you could take some photos or scans of your copy to replace the small
image, that would be great. The best procedure is to take photos of the front and back of the cover, each of the disc
labels and each page of the booklet (if there is one). Take them from front-on (not at an angle) in good light –
preferably in daylight but without the sun shining on the object. Then rotate them if necessary to make them
'horizontal' and crop them to the edges of the box/booklet and the edges of the disc labels – seeing the whole disc
surface is of no use. Your computer or smart-phone will have inbuilt editing software that will allow you to crop the
images, and most also allow you to rotate them. Please make sure they are at least 600 pixels wide (the maximum display
width) so that text is as legible as possible.
