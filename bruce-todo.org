------ Get It On

At

 o https://brucebase.wikispaces.com/1994#211094

"BANG A GONG (GET IT ON)" is mentioned whereas at 

 o https://brucebase.wikispaces.com/Get+It+On

it's called "Get It On"

According to wikipedia

 o https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_It_On_%28T._Rex_song%29

"Get It On" was retitled to "Bang a Gong (Get It On)" in the US to avoid confusion with a song of the same name by the group Chase.

Can we make this consistent at

The event at

already uses the right name, but the hyperlink in the text points to nowhere.


Thanks

* Fever and Sha La La

------ "Fever"

At

 o https://brucebase.wikispaces.com/Fever

"Fever" is mentioned to have been played at the event

 o https://brucebase.wikispaces.com/1990#140490

But the event entry actually references the Bruce song "The Fever" in the songlist and the accompanying text description.

What is right here ?

----- Sha La La

It seems that the official name is "Sha-La-La"

See

Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, Radio Broadcast of the late show live on WLIR-FM as part of its weekly Tuesday evening simulcast at My Father's Place, Roslyn, NY on July 31, 1973. From  WLIR Master tape. Setlist and run times below!!

01. Intro 0:00:00
02. Fourth Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy) 0:00:42
03. New York City Serenade 0:10:47

06. It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City 0:31:46
07. You Mean So Much To Me 0:35:24
08. Thundercrack 0:44:56

The orchestral violin/string sounds heard during "New York City Serenade" were produced by using a rented Mellotron (unlike the real strings on the album version)

The story of the tape:
I'm sure you are saying, how could this guy get a copy off the WLIR tape? Well......I made friends with a DJ at WCOZ in Boston (now defunct). He had done a brief stint at WLIR. When he left WLIR, he took the reel of tape with him. By the way...this was very common as I found out later. He introduced me to a few of his friends and I was able to trade various things for copies of shows. Most of the time I was able to take the tapes home. Every now and then I had to make a copy at the station. Soon he left Boston for somewhere else and we parted good friends....So....for a very brief period in my life...I got lucky......Like they say...nothing lasts forever! I hope you enjoy it.

Info Brucebase:

One show, double bill with Springsteen & the E Street Band headlining and folk
stylist Jae Mason opening, albeit with a short, thirty-minute set. Booked by the
nearby Hobart & William Smith College. "It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City"
includes a spoken rap portion, as well as the police siren prop during the
instrumental. "Jungleland" is one of the versions including some lyrics that
were later discarded. Clarence Clemons takes lead vocals on "Gimme That Wine",
which appears in the set once again when Springsteen breaks a guitar string and
needs time to change it, leaving the band to vamp until his return. This
sixteen-song set includes possibly the longest "New York City Serenade" known,
clocking in at over twenty-four minutes. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes
a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection. "A Love So Fine" includes an
instrumental snippet of "Shout".

Info from Brucebase:
Bruce's first ever appearance in Europe. An audience tape confirmed tour performance of "Lost In The Flood", last played in October 1974. However, the number of incomplete / unknown setlists around October and November 1975 mean it may not be the first time the song was actually performed. "Thunder Road" is the slow version with Roy on piano and Bruce on harmonica and vocals. The introduction to "Spirit In The Night" includes the opening lines from Lloyd Price's "Stagger Lee", although the official release credits them to Ahlert and Leslie's "The Moon Was Yellow (And The Night Was Young)", apparently mistakenly. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes the "Come A Little Bit Closer" introduction and a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection. "For You" is solo piano. Bruce's first show outside North America was turbulent. Before the show Springsteen tore "Finally London is ready for Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band" promotional posters from the walls - furious with the hype and publicity. The controversy clearly affected the performance as the DVD shows a somewhat sombre Springsteen, not the usual livewire. His mood is perhaps most evident in the introduction to "The E Street Shuffle". Normally a rambling tale, Bruce tails off after just a few sentences, going straight into the song. The show is still intense however, with outstanding versions of "Lost In The Flood" and "It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City", amongst others.

Info from Brucebase:
Despite newspaper reports to the contrary, the show does not feature a unique performance of "Here Comes Santa Claus", a cover of the early 60s Bob B. Soxx & The Blue Jeans / Phil Spector-produced hit; instead the tape confirms the expected performance of "Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town." This song was immediately followed by Santa making a surprise appearance onstage, clowning around with Bruce, and handing out toy instruments as gifts to the band. "Thunder Road" is the slow version with Roy on piano and Bruce on harmonica and vocals. During "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)", which includes a snippet of "Theme From Shaft" in the midsection, Bruce changes the lyrics to "I want to Kung-Fu ya, sock it to ya, I wanna be your man." "For You" is solo piano.

Info bootleg:

The Chicken Scratch tour draws its name from the trek's circuitous routing and
it hit several markets that were missed on the previous year's tour, including
the Carolinas. Bruce alludes to this foray south at a couple points in the show,
asking if anyone in the crowd was down from Jersey or New York ("we got the same
crowd following us around everywhere"). He also name drops "Ducky Slattery",
made famous during the WMMR-FM 1973 Main Point broadcast
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0H0vv...) saying that he used to tell a story
about this guy who lived next to a gas station.

Info from Brucebase:

The above presumably complete setlist is culled from the audience recording
(which contains the full set, save for "Quarter To Three", information from a
May 20, 1976 report in Rolling Stone, and a brief review in Duke University's
student newspaper. A Brucebase reader present also adds that he recollects "It's
My Life" and that "I distinctly remember looking down the row of people and
seeing that every single one of them had their mouths open (as did I) in stunned
silence, mesmerized by the story and the music. It was thrilling." This is one
of only a few shows in which all eight songs from the Born To Run album are
performed. First confirmed public Springsteen performance of "Raise Your Hand,"
and the recording supports that claim as Springsteen calls out chord changes to
the band. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" includes a snippet of "Theme From Shaft"
in the midsection. Some sources suggest that "Kitty's Back" was played, but
there is no evidence of it on the audience recording.

piano rendition previously used) and the earliest known recorded "Raise Your
Hand", although it was played earlier than this. "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)"
features an extended mariachi-style introduction. And the live premiere of
"Frankie". This is also one of the few known times that the whole of the Born To

Springsteen and the E Street Band at Jai Alai Fronton, Miami, FL on March
6, 1977. Audience tape and incomplete, missing the last two songs of the show,
"Born To Run" and "Quarter To Three" You can find it on the bootlegs
"Jacksonville & My Father's Place" and "Talk It In Our Hearts" (Ev2) and have
the wrong dates. Setlist and run times below!

12. Backstreets 0:56:52
13. Jungleland 1:10:38
14. Rosalita (Come Out Tonight) (with The Miami Horns) [fades out] 1:21:43

According to the info included with the bootleg: The introductory story to "It's My Life" is one of the best, again featuring Bruce talk about his relationship with his father, is very emotional. And this version of "Backstreets" could be nominated for one of the best ever."
Backstreets including the "...wishing that God would send some angels and blow this whole town right into the sea" lines in the interlude."

IMPORTANT NOTE:

This show has always been dated to 1977-03-04 Civic Auditorium, Jacksonville,
FL. According to Brucebase and upon close examination of the audience recording
of the March 6, 1977 show at Jai Alai Fronton in Miami, FL it has been
discovered it is the exact same recording as 'Jacksonville (& My Father's
Place)'. The evidence we have strongly suggests that the recording actually
dates from March 6, and therefore no audio circulates from March 4 in
Jacksonville. The tapes used for the recent JEMS Archive release of March 6 were
obtained in the 80s, pre-dating the 1996 release of 'Jacksonville (& My Father's
Place). Unfortunately the taper of this fine recording, John Tsalikes, passed
away in 2003.

Well far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll
We ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashing
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sound
We gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing*

Well flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight
And flashing for the refugees who run in the, in the night*
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

Now even though a cloud-like curtain in a far-off corner flashed*
And the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting
The electric light struck like the arrows
Fired but for the ones condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting

That's right!

Tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless seeking trail
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale
And for each and every burned out soul placed inside a jail*
We gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

Let's go!
[sax solo]

Now starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall when we were caught
Can't find no tracks of hours, they'd hang suspended*
And as we listened the last time and we watched with one last look
Spellbound and swallowed and to the tolling we ended*

Tolling for the aching ones whose wounds cannot be nursed
For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe
We gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing
Yeah we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

This show was originally scheduled for August 8. 29-song set includes "Thunder Road" to open, "Summertime Blues", "Jackson Cage" and "For You". Bruce sings a bit of Chubby Checker's "Let's Twist Again" as an introduction to "I'm A Rocker".
No doubt the firecrackers, which some fool sets off a couple times early, anger Bruce: he makes a "short public announcement" after “Prove It All Night” that leaves nothing to the imagination.

On a glorious, hot summer day in June 1985 Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band played a now legendary gig in the beautiful surroundings of Slane Castle in County Meath, Ireland.
It was their first appearance in Ireland and began a love affair with Irish crowds that culminated in five sold-out gigs throughout the country in summer 2013.
Here is the full performance, along with some photos I took on the day.

First ever performances in the U.S. for "All Or Nothin' At All" and "Real Man". “Open All Night” is a new arrangement with Bruce playing the song alone on the guitar all the way through with help from Roy on the keyboards and Shane on the slide guitar before the full band kicking in at the end. The second set includes the last known "Real Man" and the final "Tougher Than The Rest" of the tour. "The Star-Spangled Banner", "Born In The U.S.A.", "Light Of Day" and "Glory Days" are not in the archive of this concert, that's why they do not appear. Second night of the eleven there was in East Rutherford and New Jersey. This concert is part of the tour "World Tour 1992" in U.S.

Incredibly emotional show after the passing of Danny Federici. This show and all
others on the rest of this leg of the tour open with a tribute film montage set
to "Blood Brothers." Several songs are played clearly with Danny in mind -
"Backstreets" opens, plus "4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)", "Growin' Up" (for
the first time in 2008), and "I'll Fly Away." "4th Of July, Asbury Park
(Sandy)"features the Harley lyrics.

** Bruce Springsteen - FULL SHOW - Frankfurt 25.5.2012 MULTICAM

I am uploading the 20 best full show Bruce multicams I created (2016 shows not included!). Each week one show. Starting with the lowest in the list and moving on upwards...
This one takes place number 17.
For the full show and many more full shows in HIGH DEFINITION on blu-ray contact me via email: brucespringsteen at netcologne dot de
Here is the list of the 20 best multicams:
01. Leeds 2013
02. Paris 2012 night 2
03. Milano 2013
04. Uncasville 2014 night 2
05. Wembley 2013
06. Paris 2012 night 1
07. Mönchengladbach 2013
08. Stockholm 2013 night 2 
09. Stockholm 2013 night 1 
10. Hannover 2013
11. Uncasville 2014 night 1
12. Rome 2013
13. Philadelphia 28.3.2012
14. Stockholm 2013 night 3 
15. Paris 2013 
16. Copenhagen 2013 
17. Frankfurt 2012
18. Naples 2013
19. Kilkenny 2013 night 2
20. Kilkenny 2013 night 1

It was tough to rank the videos. Some were easy (the number 1 for example), others were not so easy to rank them.
The ranking is based on audio/video quality, the performance and the feedback I received for my blu-rays.
You may disagree with the order of this ranking in some cases but in either case these are the 20 best audience-shot full show Bruce videos that exist.
Most of them were filmed by me and close friends. People I don't know in person or met at the shows sent me their videos, too, and I snatched a couple videos from youtube. 
Over the years more and more friends and people who asked for camera/shooting tips followed my recommendations and it all came together in Leeds which still as of today makes the by far best video there is even though the cameras used back then are way outdated by now.
Leeds does not only rival official releases! Now imagine a concert film from the River tour shot in 4k with multiple angles!
Regarding which camera models to chose and shooting tips here is an updated info video on that matter: www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6wi3yJUYqM
Cellphones and Ipades should be forbidden at concerts. That is my very strong opinion. People look at their phones and block other people's view and what for? For crappy photos/videos nobody will watch ever again. 
Yeah, your phone may do 4k videos, too, but they will look like crap most of the time!
A bad digital camera is just as worse as a cellphone in my opinion. You get a decent 1080p camera for under 300 Euro so why go and buy one that is bad?
I will be doing quite a few European River 2016 blu-rays but I will concentrate on 4k footage. I hope for one video that will be even better than Leeds.
So go and buy yourself a nice 4k camera now like the Panasonic TZ101 or if money is tight go and buy the HX90V which is a great 1080p camera and does 24p, too! I hope we reach the climate at the Paris shows and many great 4k films will be made those nights and I can put them all together to create a new BEST VIDEO.
The AccorHotels Arena is the perfect contender because it is indoors, the venue is great and two of my greatest films and best shows available on video took place there. There is magic in the air!

Published on Jan 4, 2018
Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band - Live at HK Areena in Turku, Finland on May 8th 2013.

Second show in Turku, and a great night with plenty of rarities.

The 27-song set opens with a solo acoustic "I'll Work For Your Love", only previously performed at the Helsinki pre-show in 2012. Additional rarities include "Long Walk Home", "Blinded By The Light" (for the fourth time this tour), "Does This Bus Stop At 82nd Street?", "Ain't Good Enough For You" (second time on the tour), and "Racing In The Street" to open the encores.

* Bruce Springsteen ‎| Odds & Sods |Rarities | Unofficial Release | 2017

Joao Miguel Figueiredo Silva
Published on Aug 9, 2017
Bruce Springsteen ‎| Odds & Sods | Rarities | Unofficial Release | Compilation 1974-2017 | 2017

Setlist

"1 Tunnel of Love – August 3, 2005 – Van Andel Arena, Grand Rapids, MI
Perhaps the most moving performance on the entire 2005 tour was "Tunnel of Love."
This stunning electric-piano arrangement is the only time Springsteen played it like
this.

2 Coming Home – March 14, 1972 – Challenger Eastern Surfboards, Highlands. NJ
Six songs from this Bruce Springsteen Band recording session have previously circulated
as part of the Uber series. "Coming Home" is one of two "lost" songs from Challenger
beyond the original six. It was performed live by the Bruce Springsteen band in
late 1971-early 1972.

3 Cadillac Ranch – Spring 1980 – Power Station, New York, NY
The mixing sessions for The River yielded endless alternate versions, most very
similar to what was eventually released. This take of "Cadillac Ranch" includes
experimental sound effects in the intro and a completely different lead guitar.
A novelty to be sure, but still fun to hear.

4 Prove It All Night – July 5, 1978 – The Forum, Inglewood, CA
Who doesn't want another soundboard version of "Prove It All Night" from 1978?
Recorded two days before the famous Roxy broadcast, this recording opens with Bruce
telling the story about defacing the Darkness On The Edge of Town billboard on the
Sunset strip with spray paint.

5 State Trooper – November 15, 1999 – Gund Arena, Cleveland, OH
Other than a one-off version featuring Win and Regine from Arcade Fire in 2007,
"State Trooper" has not been performed live in a full-band arrangement since the
E Street Band reunited. During a 1999 soundcheck, Bruce worked on a new arrangement
but it never made a set list.

6 Kitty’s Back – July?, 1973 – unknown venue
This is the earliest known live version of "Kitty's Back." No known details about its
location or date, but lyrical variations (compared to later versions) suggest it is
circa summer of 1973.

7 The Patriot Game – May 17, 2005 – Tower Theater, Upper Darby, PA
Bruce took at stab at this beloved Irish ballad penned by Dominic Behan during a 2005
soundcheck. Like "State Trooper," it never appeared in an actual set.

8 Devils & Dust – April 11, 2003 – Pacific Coliseum, Vancouver, BC
Full-band run through of the then-new song two years before its release on the album
of the same name. This soundcheck features an entirely different (though thematically
similar) second verse and lyrical variations throughout.

9 Backstreets – August 6, 2005 – Fox Theater, St. Louis, MO
Of all the songs Bruce attempted as piano pieces on the D&D tour, he only got to this
classic towards the end for but three appearances. An absolutely sublime performance,
and Bruce's reaction at the end suggests he even surprised himself with the majesty
of what he played.

10 Does This Bus Stop at 82nd Street? – January 6, 1974 – Joe’s Place, Cambridge, MA
In the afternoon before a gig at Joe's Place, Bruce and the band ran through "Does This
Bus Stop at 82nd Street?" for possible inclusion in a TV telethon for Muscular Dystrophy.
That footage, if it was even filmed, has never surfaced, but this spirited take
survives.

11 Gulf Coast Highway – May 1988, Madison Square Garden, New York, NY
During a soundcheck in the final days of the US Tunnel of Love tour, Bruce and the band
try their hand at Nanci Griffith's beautiful "Gulf Coast Highway." While they never
completed the arrangement or performed it in concert, this brief glimpse is lovely in
its own right.

12 I’ll Stand By You Always – copyright June 13, 2001 – Thrill Hill East, Rumson, NJ
Bruce gave this to the producers of the first Harry Potter movie for possible inclusion.
It went unused, but has been widely written about in recent months by those who have
heard it.

13 Blood Brothers – January 9, 1995 – The Hit Factory, New York, NY
Bruce played "Blood Brothers" solo acoustic for the first time on opening night of the
2017 tour in Australia. During the 1995 Greatest Hits sessions, he tried it that way
as well to stunning effect."

* Steel Mill (Bruce Springsteen) 1971-01-23 live at The Upstage, Asbury Park

Trond Johansen
Published on Jan 24, 2015
Steel Mill (Early Bruce Springsteen band) 1971-01-23 live at The Upstage, Asbury Park. This is the only recording that exists of Steel Mill/Bruce Springsteen at the famous The Upstage, and also Steel Mills`s last performance there.

Tracklist:

1. Sweet Melinda  00:00
2. Oh Mama 04:39
3. Guilty 08:59

Bruce Springsteen (guitar and vocals)
Robbin Thompson (vocals)
Steven Van Zandt (bass)
Vini Lopez (drums)
Danny Federici (organ)

From BruceBase:

One show, double bill, with Steel Mill headlining and National Debt
opening. This was advertised as the final Steel Mill gig and current evidence
supports this, including Springsteen noting this fact at D'Scene earlier in the
week. The dissolution of Steel Mill was amicable. Apparently Bruce had informed
members in December, prior to a Christmas trip to California, of his desire to
explore other musical directions. Speaking of his brief, 5 month (September
1970 - January 1971) Steel Mill tenure, vocalist Robbin Thompson has commented:
“it was a strange thing. No one really knew why I was in the band….but about
half way through I knew the band, as it was, wasn’t going to last, especially
me.”

The above-mentioned partial setlist is taken from a very good quality soundboard
recording that is now in circulation. This material has yet to appear on any
mainstream CD boot. The audio features continuity between songs and marks the
first ever appearance of any Springsteen audio from The Upstage. These three
songs are culled from early in the set and may possibly be the show’s opening
three numbers. This is also the first time a rendition of “Sweet Melinda” has
surfaced in nice sound quality. The remainder of the show has not surfaced.

* Blinded By The Light: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack Out August 9

July 8, 2019-New York, NY-Columbia Records/Legacy Recordings, a division of Sony Music Entertainment, will release Blinded By The Light: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack (digital and CD configurations) on Friday, August 9.

2LP 12" vinyl configurations of Blinded By The Light: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack will be available Friday, August 30 with Barnes & Noble offering an exclusive 2LP 12" orange vinyl edition of the album.

Pre-order here: https://BlindedByTheLight.lnk.to/PreOrder.

Blinded By The Light: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack brings together 12 essential Bruce Springsteen performances ranging from greatest hits and fan favorites ("Born To Run," "Dancing In The Dark," "Hungry Heart," "Because The Night") to previously unreleased tracks, including the long-sought-after studio recording of "I'll Stand By You." Also, for the first time on album, Blinded By The Light: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack presents two live rarities: the debut live performance of "The River" (from No Nukes '79 - Madison Square Garden, NYC - September 21, 1979) and an unforgettable acoustic solo performance of "The Promised Land" (Concert for Valor - The National Mall, Washington DC, November 11, 2014).

In addition to the Springsteen performances, Blinded By The Light: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack includes period tracks and dialog from the film and premieres "For You My Love," a new song written for the film by soundtrack composer A.R. Rahman ("Slumdog Millionaire"). Rahman has won six National Film Awards, two Academy Awards, two Grammy Awards, a BAFTA Award, a Golden Globe Award, fifteen Filmfare Awards and seventeen Filmfare Awards South.

Inspired by a true story (Sarfraz Manzoor's Greetings from Bury Park: Race, Religion and Rock N' Roll) and the words and music of Bruce Springsteen, New Line Cinema's "Blinded by the Light" is the new coming-of-age film directed by Gurinder Chadha ("Bend It Like Beckham"). The film follows Javed (Viveik Kalra), a British teen of Pakistani descent, growing up in Luton, England in 1987. Javed's turbulent life amidst the racial and economic turmoil of the times is transformed when he is introduced to the music of Bruce Springsteen.

"As a lifelong Bruce fan, I am delighted how this soundtrack takes you through the experience of watching my movie with Springsteen music complemented by the other tracks, including very personal tracks—from my dad's favorite song to a British Bhangra anthem," said writer-director-producer Chadha. "Growing up, Sarfraz and I could never have imagined a universe where all these songs would be on one soundtrack reflecting our lives."

Chadha directed "Blinded by the Light" from a screenplay by Manzoor, Chadha and Paul Mayeda Berges. Chadha, Jane Barclay and Jamal Daniel produced the film, with Tory Metzger, Renee Witt, Peter Touche, Stephen Spence, Hannah Leader, Tracy Nurse, and Berges serving as executive producers. "Blinded by the Light" is a New Line Cinema presentation, in association with Levantine Films and Ingenious Media. Slated for release on August 14, 2019, it will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures.

A breakout smash at this year's Sundance Film Festival, "Blinded by the Light" has been hailed by critics as "a delirious and romantic rock 'n' roll parable…[an] incandescent ode to the life force of pop music" (Variety) and "pure, ingenuous joy" (Entertainment Weekly). Collider called it, "One of the year's best films" while the New York Post said, "Guaranteed to make you feel better than any other film this year." Indiewire said "Glorious" while The Wrap observed it was "Damn near irresistible."
